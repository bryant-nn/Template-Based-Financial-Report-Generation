  1.1a:
  - Atmosphere  Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the
    Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The period from 1983 to
    2012 was very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years in the Northern
    Hemisphere, where such assessment is possible and likely the warmest 30-year period
    of the last 1400 years.  The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface
    temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65
    to 1.06] °C20 over the period 1880 to 2012, for which multiple independently produced
    datasets exist. The total increase between the average of the 1850–1900 period
    and the 2003–2012 period is 0.78 [0.72 to 0.85] °C, based on the single longest
    dataset available. For the longest period when calculation of regional trends
    is sufficiently complete, almost the entire globe has experienced surface warming.  In
    addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged surface temperature
    exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability. Due to this natural
    variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning
    and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example,
    the rate of warming over the past 15 years , which begins with a strong El Niño,
    is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951 .  Based on multiple independent
    analyses of measurements, it is virtually certain that globally the troposphere
    has warmed and the lower stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century. There
    is medium confidence in the rate of change and its vertical structure in the Northern
    Hemisphere extratropical troposphere.  Confidence in precipitation change averaged
    over global land areas since 1901 is low prior to 1951 and medium afterwards.
    Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation
    has likely increased since 1901 . For other latitudes area-averaged long-term
    positive or negative trends have low confidence.
  1.1b:
  - Ocean  Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system,
    accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 with
    only about 1% stored in the atmosphere. On a global scale, the ocean warming is
    largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C
    per decade over the period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper
    ocean warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971.
    It is likely that the ocean warmed from 700 to 2000 m from 1957 to 2009 and from
    3000 m to the bottom for the period 1992 to 2005.  It is very likely that regions
    of high surface salinity, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline,
    while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher
    since the 1950s. These regional trends in ocean salinity provide indirect evidence
    for changes in evaporation and precipitation over the oceans and thus for changes
    in the global water cycle. There is no observational evidence of a long-term trend
    in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.  Since the beginning of the
    industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted in acidification of the ocean;
    the pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1, corresponding to a 26% increase
    in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration. There is medium confidence
    that, in parallel to warming, oxygen concentrations have decreased in coastal
    waters and in the open ocean thermocline in many ocean regions since the 1960s,
    with a likely expansion of tropical oxygen minimum zones in recent decades.

    ocean warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971.
    It is likely that the ocean warmed from 700 to 2000 m from 1957 to 2009 and from
    3000 m to the bottom for the period 1992 to 2005.  It is very likely that regions
    of high surface salinity, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline,
    while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher
    since the 1950s. These regional trends in ocean salinity provide indirect evidence
    for changes in evaporation and precipitation over the oceans and thus for changes
    in the global water cycle. There is no observational evidence of a long-term trend

  1.1e:
  - Cryosphere  Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets
    have been losing mass. Glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide. Northern
    Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued to decrease in extent. There is high
    confidence that there are strong regional differences in the trend in Antarctic
    sea ice extent, with a very likely increase in total extent.  Glaciers have lost
    mass and contributed to sea level rise throughout the 20th century. The rate of
    ice mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet has very likely substantially increased
    over the period 1992 to 2011, resulting in a larger mass loss over 2002 to 2011
    than over 1992 to 2011. The rate of ice mass loss from the Antarctic ice sheet,
    mainly from the northern Antarctic Peninsula and the Amundsen Sea sector of West
    Antarctica, is also likely larger over 2002 to 2011.  The annual mean Arctic sea
    ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012. The rate of decrease was very
    likely in the range 3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea ice extent has decreased
    in every season and in every successive decade since 1979, with the most rapid
    decrease in decadal mean extent in summer . For the summer sea ice minimum, the
    decrease was very likely in the range of 9.4 to 13.6% per decade  . It is very
    likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea ice extent increased in the range of
    1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high confidence
    that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing
    in some regions and decreasing in others.  There is very high confidence that
    the extent of Northern Hemisphere snow cover has decreased since the mid-20th
    century by 1.6 [0.8 to 2.4] % per decade for March and April, and 11.7% per decade
    for June, over the 1967 to 2012 period. There is high confidence that permafrost
    temperatures have increased in most regions of the Northern Hemisphere since the
    early 1980s, with reductions in thickness and areal extent in some regions. The
    increase in permafrost temperatures has occurred in response to increased surface
    temperature and changing snow cover.
  1.1g:
  - Sea level  Over the period 1901–2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17
    to 0.21] m. The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger
    than the mean rate during the previous two millennia.  It is very likely that
    the mean rate of global averaged sea level rise was 1.7 [1.5 to 1.9] mm/yr between
    1901 and 2010 and 3.2 [2.8 to 3.6] mm/yr between 1993 and 2010. Tide gauge and
    satellite altimeter data are consistent regarding the higher rate during the latter
    period. It is likely that similarly high rates occurred between 1920 and 1950.  Since
    the early 1970s, glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion from warming together
    explain about 75% of the observed global mean sea level rise. Over the period
    1993–2010, global mean sea level rise is, with high confidence, consistent with
    the sum of the observed contributions from ocean thermal expansion, due to warming,
    from changes in glaciers, the Greenland ice sheet, the Antarctic ice sheet and
    land water storage.  Rates of sea level rise over broad regions can be several
    times larger or smaller than the global mean sea level rise for periods of several
    decades, due to fluctuations in ocean circulation. Since 1993, the regional rates
    for the Western Pacific are up to three times larger than the global mean, while
    those for much of the Eastern Pacific are near zero or negative.  There is very
    high confidence that maximum global mean sea level during the last interglacial
    period was, for several thousand years, at least 5 m higher than present and high
    confidence that it did not exceed 10 m above present. During the last interglacial
    period, the Greenland ice sheet very likely contributed between 1.4 and 4.3 m
    to the higher global mean sea level, implying with medium confidence an additional
    contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. This change in sea level occurred in
    the context of different orbital forcing and with high-latitude surface temperature,
    averaged over several thousand years, at least 2°C warmer than present .
  1.2a:
  - 'Natural and anthropogenic radiative forcings  Atmospheric concentrations of GHGs
    are at levels that are unprecedented in at least 800, years. Concentrations of
    carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have all shown large increases since
    1750  . CO2 concentrations are increasing at the fastest observed decadal rate
    of change for 2002– 2011. After almost one decade of stable CH4 concentrations
    since the late 1990s, atmospheric measurements have shown renewed increases since
    2007. N2O concentrations have steadily increased at a rate of 0.73 ± 0.03 ppb/yr
    over the last three decades.  The total anthropogenic radiative forcing over 1750–2011
    is calculated to be a warming effect of 2.3 [1.1 to 3.3] W/m , and it has increased
    more rapidly since 1970 than during prior decades. Carbon dioxide is the largest
    single contributor to radiative forcing over 1750–2011 and its trend since 1970.
    The total anthropogenic radiative forcing estimate for 2011 is substantially higher
    than the estimate reported in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report for the year 2005.
    This is caused by a combination of continued growth in most GHG concentrations
    and an improved estimate of radiative forcing from aerosols.  The radiative forcing
    from aerosols, which includes cloud adjustments, is better understood and indicates
    a weaker cooling effect than in AR4. The aerosol radiative forcing over 1750–2011
    is estimated as –0.9 [–1.9 to −0.1] W/m . Radiative forcing from aerosols has
    two competing components: a dominant cooling effect from most aerosols and their
    cloud adjustments and a partially offsetting warming contribution from black carbon
    absorption of solar radiation. There is high confidence that the global mean total
    aerosol radiative forcing has counteracted a substantial portion of radiative
    forcing from wellmixed GHGs. Aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty
    to the total radiative forcing estimate.  Changes in solar irradiance and volcanic
    aerosols cause natural radiative forcing. The radiative forcing from stratospheric
    volcanic aerosols can have a large cooling effect on the climate system for some
    years after major volcanic eruptions. Changes in total solar irradiance are calculated
    to have contributed only around 2% of the total radiative forcing in 2011, relative
    to 1750.'
  - Human activities affecting emission drivers  About half of the cumulative anthropogenic
    CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years . Cumulative
    anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 2040 ± 310 GtCO2 were added to the atmosphere between
    1750 and 2011. Since 1970, cumulative CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion,
    cement production and flaring have tripled, and cumulative CO2 emissions from
    forestry and other land use22 have increased by about 40% 23. In 2011, annual
    CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion, cement production and flaring were
    34.8 ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr. For 2002–2011, average annual emissions from FOLU were 3.3
    ± 2.9 GtCO2/yr.  About 40% of these anthropogenic CO2 emissions have remained
    in the atmosphere since 1750. The rest was removed from the atmosphere by sinks,
    and stored in natural carbon cycle reservoirs. Sinks from ocean uptake and vegetation
    with soils account, in roughly equal measures, for the remainder of the cumulative
    CO2 emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2,
    causing ocean acidification.  Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued
    to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between 2000 and
    2010. Despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies, annual GHG
    emissions grew on average by 1.0 GtCO2-eq per year, from 2000 to 2010, compared
    to 0.4 GtCO2-eq per year, from 1970 to 2000 24. Total anthropogenic GHG emissions
    from 2000 to 2010 were the highest in human history and reached 49 GtCO2-eq/yr
    in 2010. The global economic crisis of 2007/2008 reduced emissions only temporarily.  CO2
    emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about
    78% to the total GHG emission increase between 1970 and 2010, with a contribution
    of similar percentage over the 2000–2010 period. Fossil-fuel-related CO2 emissions
    reached 32 GtCO2/yr, in 2010, and grew further by about 3% between 2010 and 2011,
    and by about 1 to 2% between 2011 and 2012. CO2 remains the major anthropogenic
    GHG, accounting for 76% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010. Of the total,
    16% comes from CH4, 6.2% from N2O, and 2.0% from fluorinated gases 25. Annually,
    since 1970, about 25% of anthropogenic GHG emissions have been in the form of
    non-CO2 gases.  Total annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased by about
    10 GtCO2-eq between 2000 and 2010. This increase directly came from the energy,
    industry, transport and building sectors. Accounting for indirect emissions raises
    the contributions by the building and industry sectors. Since 2000, GHG emissions
    have been growing in all sectors, except in agriculture, forestry and other land
    use 22. In 2010, 35% of GHG emissions were released by the energy sector, 24%
    from AFOLU, 21% by industry, 14% by transport and 6.4% by the building sector.
    When emissions from electricity and heat production are attributed to the sectors
    that use the final energy, the shares of the industry and building sectors in
    global GHG emissions are increased to 31% and 19%, respectively.  See also Box
    3.2 for contributions from various sectors, based on metrics other than 100-year
    Global Warming Potential. Globally, economic and population growth continue to
    be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion.
    The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical
    to that of the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth
    has risen sharply. Between 2000 and 2010, both drivers outpaced emission reductions
    from improvements in energy intensity of gross domestic product. Increased use
    of coal relative to other energy sources has reversed the long-standing trend
    in gradual decarbonization  of the world’s energy supply.
  1.2c:
  - Attribution of climate  changes and impacts The evidence for human influence on
    the climate system has grown since AR4. Human influence has been detected in warming
    of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions
    in snow and ice, and in global mean sea level rise; and it is extremely likely
    to have been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid20th century.
    In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human
    systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate
    change, irrespective of its cause, indicating the sensitivity of natural and human
    systems to changing climate. The causes of observed changes in the climate system,
    as well as in any natural or human system impacted by climate, are established
    following a consistent set of methods. Detection addresses the question of whether
    climate or a natural or human system affected by climate has actually changed
    in a statistical sense, while attribution evaluates the relative contributions
    of multiple causal factors to an observed change or event with an assignment of
    statistical confidence. Attribution of climate change to causes quantifies the
    links between observed climate change and human activity, as well as other, natural,
    climate drivers. In contrast, attribution of observed impacts to climate change
    considers the links between observed changes in natural or human systems and observed
    climate change, regardless of its cause. Results from studies attributing climate
    change to causes provide estimates of the magnitude of warming in response to
    changes in radiative forcing and hence support projections of future climate change.
    Results from studies attributing impacts to climate change provide strong indications
    for the sensitivity of natural or human systems to future climate change.
  1.3a:
  - Observed impacts attributed to climate change  In recent decades, changes in climate
    have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across
    the oceans. Impacts are due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause,
    indicating the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate. Evidence
    of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural
    systems. Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change,
    with a major or minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other
    influences. Impacts on human systems are often geographically heterogeneous because
    they depend not only on changes in climate variables but also on social and economic
    factors. Hence, the changes are more easily observed at local levels, while attribution
    can remain difficult.  In many regions, changing precipitation or melting snow
    and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms
    of quantity and quality. Glaciers continue to shrink almost worldwide due to climate
    change , affecting runoff and water resources downstream . Climate change is causing
    permafrost warming and thawing in high-latitude regions and in high-elevation
    regions .  Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their
    geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species
    interactions in response to ongoing climate change. While only a few recent species
    extinctions have been attributed as yet to climate change , natural global climate
    change at rates slower than current anthropogenic climate change caused significant
    ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions of years. Increased
    tree mortality, observed in many places worldwide, has been attributed to climate
    change in some regions. Increases in the frequency or intensity of ecosystem disturbances
    such as droughts, windstorms, fires and pest outbreaks have been detected in many
    parts of the world and in some cases are attributed to climate change . Numerous
    observations over the last decades in all ocean basins show changes in abundance,
    distribution shifts poleward and/ or to deeper, cooler waters for marine fishes,
    invertebrates and phytoplankton, and altered ecosystem composition , tracking
    climate trends. Some warm-water corals and their reefs have responded to warming
    with species replacement, bleaching, and decreased coral cover causing habitat
    loss . Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed
    to human influence, from the thinning of pteropod and foraminiferan shells to
    the declining growth rates of corals. Oxygen minimum zones are progressively expanding
    in the tropical Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, due to reduced ventilation
    and O2 solubility in warmer, more stratified oceans, and are constraining fish
    habitat.  Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops
    shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common
    than positive impacts . The smaller number of studies showing positive impacts
    relate mainly to high-latitude regions, though it is not yet clear whether the
    balance of impacts has been negative or positive in these regions. Climate change
    has negatively affected wheat and maize yields for many regions and in the global
    aggregate. Effects on rice and soybean yield have been smaller in major production
    regions and globally, with a median change of zero across all available data which
    are fewer for soy compared to the other crops. Observed impacts relate mainly
    to production aspects of food security rather than access or other components
    of food security. Since AR4, several periods of rapid food and cereal price increases
    following climate extremes in key producing regions indicate a sensitivity of
    current markets to climate extremes among other factors .  At present the worldwide
    burden of human ill-health from climate change is relatively small compared with
    effects of other stressors and is not well quantified. However, there has been
    increased heat-related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality in some
    regions as a result of warming. Local changes in temperature and rainfall have
    altered the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and disease vectors.  ‘Cascading’
    impacts of climate change can now be attributed along chains of evidence from
    physical climate through to intermediate systems and then to people. The changes
    in climate feeding into the cascade, in some cases, are linked to human drivers
    , while, in other cases, assessments of the causes of observed climate change
    leading into the cascade are not available. In all cases, confidence in detection
    and attribution to observed climate change decreases for effects further down
    each impact chain.
  1.4a:
  - Extreme events  Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed
    since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human influences,
    including a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an increase in warm temperature
    extremes, an increase in extreme high sea levels and an increase in the number
    of heavy precipitation events in a number of regions. It is very likely that the
    number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights
    has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves
    has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely
    that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the
    frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century.
    It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence
    of heat waves in some locations.  There is medium confidence that the observed
    warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased coldrelated human
    mortality in some regions. Extreme heat events currently result in increases in
    mortality and morbidity in North America , and in Europe with impacts that vary
    according to people’s age, location and socio-economic factors.  There are likely
    more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased
    than where it has decreased. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation
    events has likely increased in North America and Europe. In other continents,
    confidence in trends is at most medium. It is very likely that global near-surface
    and tropospheric air specific humidity has increased since the 1970s. In land
    regions where observational coverage is sufficient for assessment, there is medium
    confidence that anthropogenic forcing has contributed to a global-scale intensification
    of heavy precipitation over the second half of the 20th century.  There is low
    confidence that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and magnitude
    of fluvial floods on a global scale. The strength of the evidence is limited mainly
    by a lack of long-term records from unmanaged catchments. Moreover, floods are
    strongly influenced by many human activities impacting catchments, making the
    attribution of detected changes to climate change difficult. However, recent detection
    of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharges in some catchments
    implies greater risks of flooding on a regional scale. Costs related to flood
    damage, worldwide, have been increasing since the 1970s, although this is partly
    due to the increasing exposure of people and assets.  There is low confidence
    in observed global-scale trends in droughts, due to lack of direct observations,
    dependencies of inferred trends on the choice of the definition for drought, and
    due to geographical inconsistencies in drought trends. There is also low confidence
    in the attribution of changes in drought over global land areas since the mid-20th
    century, due to the same observational uncertainties and difficulties in distinguishing
    decadal scale variability in drought from long-term trends.  There is low confidence
    that long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity are robust, and there is low
    confidence in the attribution of global changes to any particular cause. However,
    it is virtually certain that intense tropical cyclone activity has increased in
    the North Atlantic since 1970.  It is likely that extreme sea levels  have increased
    since 1970, being mainly the result of mean sea level rise. Due to a shortage
    of studies and the difficulty of distinguishing any such impacts from other modifications
    to coastal systems, limited evidence is available on the impacts of sea level
    rise.  Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts,
    floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure
    of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability . Impacts
    of such climate-related extremes include alteration of ecosystems, disruption
    of food production and water supply, damage to infrastructure and settlements,
    human morbidity and mortality and consequences for mental health and human well-being.
    For countries at all levels of development, these impacts are consistent with
    a significant lack of preparedness for current climate variability in some sectors.  Direct
    and insured losses from weather-related disasters have increased substantially
    in recent decades, both globally and regionally. Increasing exposure of people
    and economic assets has been the major cause of long-term increases in economic
    losses from weather- and climate-related disasters.
  2.1b:
  - Key drivers of future climate and the  basis on which projections are made Cumulative
    emissions of CO 2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st
    century and beyond. Projections of greenhouse gas emissions vary over a wide range,
    depending on both socio-economic development and climate policy. Climate models
    are mathematical representations of processes important in the Earth’s climate
    system. Results from a hierarchy of climate models are considered in this report;
    ranging from simple idealized models, to models of intermediate complexity, to
    comprehensive General Circulation Models, including Earth System Models that also
    simulate the carbon cycle. The GCMs simulate many climate aspects, including the
    temperature of the atmosphere and the oceans, precipitation, winds, clouds, ocean
    currents and sea-ice extent. The models are extensively tested against historical
    observations.  In order to obtain climate change projections, the climate models
    use information described in scenarios of GHG and air pollutant emissions and
    land use patterns. Scenarios are generated by a range of approaches, from simple
    idealised experiments to Integrated Assessment Models. Key factors driving changes
    in anthropogenic GHG emissions are economic and population growth, lifestyle and
    behavioural changes, associated changes in energy use and land use, technology
    and climate policy, which are fundamentally uncertain.  The standard set of scenarios
    used in the AR5 is called Representative Concentration Pathways.  The methods
    used to estimate future impacts and risks resulting from climate change are described
    in Box 2.3. Modelled future impacts assessed in this report are generally based
    on climate-model projections using the RCPs, and in some cases, the older Special
    Report on Emissions Scenarios.  Risk of climate-related impacts results from the
    interaction between climate-related hazards  and the vulnerability and exposure
    of human and natural systems. Alternative development paths influence risk by
    changing the likelihood of climatic events and trends, through their effects on
    GHGs, pollutants and land use, and by altering vulnerability and exposure.  Experiments,
    observations and models used to estimate future impacts and risks have improved
    since the AR4, with increasing understanding across sectors and regions. For example,
    an improved knowledge base has enabled expanded assessment of risks for human
    security and livelihoods and for the oceans. For some aspects of climate change
    and climate change impacts, uncertainty about future outcomes has narrowed. For
    others, uncertainty will persist. Some of the persistent uncertainties are grounded
    in the mechanisms that control the magnitude and pace of climate change. Others
    emerge from potentially complex interactions between the changing climate and
    the underlying vulnerability and exposure of people, societies and ecosystems.
    The combination of persistent uncertainty in key mechanisms plus the prospect
    of complex interactions motivates a focus on risk in this report. Because risk
    involves both probability and consequence, it is important to consider the full
    range of possible outcomes, including low-probability, high-consequence impacts
    that are difficult to simulate.
  - Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major
    sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach
    that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of
    end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon
    sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available
    that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements
    of technology, behaviour, production and resource efficiency and enable structural
    changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry
    and other land use involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest
    degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing
    bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors
    but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and industry. An overview of sectoral
    mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4.  Well-designed systemic
    and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions
    than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector
    affecting the need for mitigation in others . In baseline scenarios without new
    mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except
    for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector. Mitigation scenarios reaching around
    450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 21004328 show largescale global changes in the
    energy supply sector . While rapid decarbonization of energy supply generally
    entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions
    lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system. There
    are thus strong interdependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution
    of the mitigation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance
    of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation . The
    next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas,
    as a large portion of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period.  Decarbonizing
    electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies
    in achieving low stabilization levels  . In most integrated modelling scenarios,
    decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry,
    buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations
    by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline
    over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below
    2010 levels between 2040 and 2070.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes,
    in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising
    development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq
    concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 . Near-term reductions in
    energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies,
    provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector,
    hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures
    and are associated with important co-benefits . Emissions can be substantially
    lowered through changes in consumption patterns  and dietary change and reduction
    in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives
    as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes.  Decarbonization
    of the energy supply sector  requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity
    generation technologies. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios
    , the share of low-carbon electricity supply, nuclear and CCS, including BECCS)
    increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050
    and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost
    entirely by 2100. Among these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE
    technologies have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at significant
    scale since AR4 and nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload
    power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining. GHG
    emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current
    world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas
    combined-cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural
    gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply
    are low or mitigated.  Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence
    on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some
    sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change
    . In the transport sector, technical and behavioural mitigation measures for all
    modes, plus new infrastructure and urban redevelopment investments, could reduce
    final energy demand significantly below baseline levels. While opportunities for
    switching to low-carbon fuels exist, the rate of decarbonization in the transport
    sector might be constrained by challenges associated with energy storage and the
    relatively low energy density of low-carbon transport fuels. In the building sector,
    recent advances in technologies, know-how and policies provide opportunities to
    stabilize or reduce global energy use to about current levels by mid-century.
    In addition, recent improvements in performance and costs make very low energy
    construction and retrofits of buildings economically attractive, sometimes even
    at net negative costs. In the industry sector, improvements in GHG emission efficiency
    and in the efficiency of material use, recycling and reuse of materials and products,
    and overall reductions in product demand  and service demand could, in addition
    to energy efficiency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. Prevalent
    approaches for promoting energy efficiency in industry include information programmes
    followed by economic instruments, regulatory approaches and voluntary actions.
    Important options for mitigation in waste management are waste reduction, followed
    by re-use, recycling and energy recovery.  The most cost-effective mitigation
    options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing
    deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions.
    In agriculture, the most cost-effective mitigation options are cropland management,
    grazing land management and restoration of organic soils . About a third of mitigation
    potential in forestry can be achieved at a cost <20 USD/tCO2-eq emission. Demand-side
    measures, such as changes in diet and reductions of losses in the food supply
    chain, have a significant, but uncertain, potential to reduce GHG emissions from
    food production .  Bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but there
    are issues to consider, such as the sustainability of practices and the efficiency
    of bioenergy systems . Evidence suggests that bioenergy options with low lifecycle
    emissions, some already available, can reduce GHG emissions; outcomes are site-specific
    and rely on efficient integrated ‘biomassto-bioenergy systems’, and sustainable
    land use management and governance. Barriers to large-scale deployment of bioenergy
    include concerns about GHG emissions from land, food security, water resources,
    biodiversity conservation and livelihoods.  Mitigation measures intersect with
    other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects.
    These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking
    climate mitigation actions . Mitigation can positively or negatively influence
    the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health,
    food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods
    and equitable sustainable development . On the other hand, policies towards other
    societal goals can influence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives.
    These influences can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify,
    especially in welfare terms. This multi-objective perspective is important in
    part because it helps to identify areas where support for policies that advance
    multiple goals will be robust. Potential co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of the main sectoral mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.5. Overall,
    the potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweigh the potential
    for adverse side effects, whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case
    for all energy supply and AFOLU measures.
  2.1c:
  - Climate system responses  Climate system properties that determine the response
    to external forcing have been estimated both from climate models and from analysis
    of past and recent climate change. The equilibrium climate sensitivity 3325is
    likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C, extremely unlikely less than 1°C, and very
    unlikely greater than 6°C.  Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global
    mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Multiple lines of evidence
    indicate a strong and consistent near-linear relationship across all scenarios
    considered between net cumulative CO2 emissions  and projected global temperature
    change to the year 2100. Past emissions and observed warming support this relationship
    within uncertainties. Any given level of warming is associated with a range of
    cumulative CO2 emissions , and therefore, for example, higher emissions in earlier
    decades imply lower emissions later.  The global mean peak surface temperature
    change per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted as CO2 is likely in the range of
    0.8°C to 2.5°C. This quantity, called the transient climate response to cumulative
    carbon emissions, is supported by both modelling and observational evidence and
    applies to cumulative emissions up to about 2000 GtC.  Warming caused by CO2 emissions
    is effectively irreversible over multi-century timescales unless measures are
    taken to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Ensuring CO2-induced warming remains
    likely less than 2°C requires cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic
    sources to remain below about 3650 GtCO2, over half of which were already emitted
    by 2011.  Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to
    less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66% would
    require total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to be limited
    to about 2900 GtCO2 when accounting for non-CO2 forcing as in the RCP2.6 scenario,
    with a range of 2550 to 3150 GtCO2 arising from variations in non-CO2 climate
    drivers across the scenarios considered by WGIII. About 1900 [1650 to 2150] GtCO2
    were emitted by 2011, leaving about 1000 GtCO2 to be consistent with this temperature
    goal. Estimated total fossil carbon reserves exceed this remaining amount by a
    factor of 4 to 7, with resources much larger still.

    factor of 4 to 7, with resources much larger still.
  2.2e:
  - Water cycle  Changes in precipitation in a warming world will not be uniform.
    The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific are likely to experience an increase
    in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century under the RCP8.5 scenario.
    In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely
    decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation will likely
    increase under the RCP8.5 scenario.  Extreme precipitation events over most mid-latitude
    land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely become more intense
    and more frequent as global mean surface temperature increases.  Globally, in
    all RCPs, it is likely that the area encompassed by monsoon systems will increase
    and monsoon precipitation is likely to intensify and El Niño-Southern Oscillation
    related precipitation variability on regional scales will likely intensify.
  2.2f:
  - Ocean, cryosphere and sea level  The global ocean will continue to warm during
    the 21st century. The strongest ocean warming is projected for the surface in
    tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical regions. At greater depth the warming
    will be most pronounced in the Southern Ocean .  It is very likely that the Atlantic
    Meridional Overturning Circulation will weaken over the 21st century, with best
    estimates and model ranges for the reduction of 11% for the RCP2.6 scenario, 34%
    for the RCP8.5. Nevertheless, it is very unlikely that the AMOC will undergo an
    abrupt transition or collapse in the 21st century.  Year-round reductions in Arctic
    sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios. The subset of models that most closely
    reproduce the observationsproject that a nearly ice-free Arctic Oceanin September
    is likely for RCP8.5 before mid-century. In the Antarctic, a decrease in sea ice
    extent and volume is projected with low confidence.  The area of Northern Hemisphere
    spring snow cover is likely to decrease by 7% for RCP2.6 and by 25% in RCP8.5
    by the end of the 21st century for the multi-model average.  It is virtually certain
    that near-surface permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced
    as global mean surface temperature increases. The area of permafrost near the
    surface  is likely to decrease by 37% to 81% for the multi-model average.  The
    global glacier volume, excluding glaciers on the periphery of Antarctica, is projected
    to decrease by 15 to 55% for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5.  Global mean
    sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century. There has been significant
    improvement in understanding and projection of sea level change since the AR4.
    Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed the
    observed rate of 2.0 [1.7–2.3] mm/yr during 1971–2010, with the rate of rise for
    RCP8.5 during 2081–2100 of 8 to 16 mm/yr .  Sea level rise will not be uniform
    across regions. By the end of the 21st century, it is very likely that sea level
    will rise in more than about 95% of the ocean area. Sea level rise depends on
    the pathway of CO2 emissions, not only on the cumulative total; reducing emissions
    earlier rather than later, for the same cumulative total, leads to a larger mitigation
    of sea level rise. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience
    sea level change within ±20% of the global mean. It is very likely that there
    will be a significant increase in the occurrence of future sea level extremes
    in some regions by 2100.
  2.2g:
  - Carbon cycle and biogeochemistry  Ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will continue
    under all four RCPs through to 2100, with higher uptake for higher concentration
    pathways. The future evolution of the land carbon uptake is less certain. A majority
    of models projects a continued land carbon uptake under all RCPs, but some models
    simulate a land carbon loss due to the combined effect of climate change and land
    use change.  Based on Earth System Models, there is high confidence that the feedback
    between climate change and the carbon cycle will amplify global warming. Climate
    change will partially offset increases in land and ocean carbon sinks caused by
    rising atmospheric CO2. As a result more of the emitted anthropogenic CO2 will
    remain in the atmosphere, reinforcing the warming.  Earth System Models project
    a global increase in ocean acidification for all RCP scenarios by the end of the
    21st century, with a slow recovery after mid-century under RCP2.6. The decrease
    in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07  for RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15
    for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 for RCP6.0, and 0.30 to 0.32 for RCP8.5 .  It is very
    likely that the dissolved oxygen content of the ocean will decrease by a few percent
    during the 21st century in response to surface warming, predominantly in the subsurface
    mid-latitude oceans. There is no consensus on the future volume of low oxygen
    waters in the open ocean because of large uncertainties in potential biogeochemical
    effects and in the evolution of tropical ocean dynamics.

  2.3a:
  - Exposure and vulnerability  The character and severity of impacts from climate
    change and extreme events emerge from risk that depends not only on climate-related
    hazards but also on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems. Exposure
    and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of social, economic and cultural
    factors and processes that have been incompletely considered to date and that
    make quantitative assessments of their future trends difficult . These factors
    include wealth and its distribution across society, demographics, migration, access
    to technology and information, employment patterns, the quality of adaptive responses,
    societal values, governance structures and institutions to resolve conflict.  Differences
    in vulnerability and exposure arise from non-climatic factors and from multidimensional
    inequalities often produced by uneven development processes. These differences
    shape differential risks from climate change. People who are socially, economically,
    culturally, politically, institutionally or otherwise marginalized are especially
    vulnerable to climate change and also to some adaptation and mitigation responses
    . This heightened vulnerability is rarely due to a single cause. Rather, it is
    the product of intersecting social processes that result in inequalities in socio-economic
    status and income, as well as in exposure. Such social processes include, for
    example, discrimination on the basis of gender, class, ethnicity, age and ability.  Climate-related
    hazards exacerbate other stressors, often with negative outcomes for livelihoods,
    especially for people living in poverty. Climate-related hazards affect poor people’s
    lives directly through impacts on livelihoods, reductions in crop yields or the
    destruction of homes, and indirectly through, for example, increased food prices
    and food insecurity. Observed positive effects for poor and marginalized people,
    which are limited and often indirect, include examples such as diversification
    of social networks and of agricultural practices.  Violent conflict increases
    vulnerability to climate change . Large-scale violent conflict harms assets that
    facilitate adaptation, including infrastructure, institutions, natural resources,
    social capital and livelihood opportunities.
  - 'Future risks and impacts caused  by a changing climate Climate change will amplify
    existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly
    distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities
    in countries at all levels of development. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase
    the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people, species
    and ecosystems. Continued high emissions would lead to mostly negative impacts
    for biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic development and amplify risks
    for livelihoods and for food and human security. Risk of climate-related impacts
    results from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability
    and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising
    rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied
    by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases,
    irreversible detrimental impacts. Future climate change will amplify existing
    climate-related risks and create new risks.  Key risks are potentially severe
    impacts relevant to understanding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
    climate system. Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability
    of societies and systems exposed, or both. Their identification is based on large
    magnitude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts;
    persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks. Some
    risks are particularly relevant for individual regions, while others are global.
    For risk assessment it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts,
    including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often
    increase with temperature and are sometimes more directly linked to other dimensions
    of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well as the magnitudes and
    rates of ocean acidification and sea level rise .  Key risks that span sectors
    and regions include the following : 1. Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted
    livelihoods resulting from storm surges, sea level rise and coastal flooding;
    inland flooding in some urban regions; and periods of extreme heat. 2. Systemic
    risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks
    and critical services. 3. Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural
    livelihoods and income, particularly for poorer populations. 4. Risk of loss of
    ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, functions and services. The overall
    risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and
    magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. Some risks are considerable
    even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. Many
    global risks are high to very high for global temperature increases of 4°C or
    more. These risks include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened
    systems, the extinction of many species, large risks to food security and compromised
    normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas
    for parts of the year, due to the combination of high temperature and humidity.
    The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible
    change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds
    in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with
    rising temperature.  Adaptation can substantially reduce the risks of climate
    change impacts, but greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the
    likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits . The potential for adaptation, as well
    as constraints and limits to adaptation, varies among sectors, regions, communities
    and ecosystems. The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely linked
    to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances. See Figure 2.4 and Table
    2.3, along with Topics 3 and 4.'
  - Climate change beyond 2100,  irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of
    climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if
    anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or
    irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming
    will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures
    will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after
    a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions . A large fraction of
    anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a
    multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal
    of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Stabilization of global average
    surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate
    system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures
    and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales that
    will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global
    surface temperature has been stabilized.  Ocean acidification will continue for
    centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems
    , and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes.  Global mean
    sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100. The few available
    analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above
    the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline
    and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing
    that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below
    1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by
    2300 . There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid
    ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate
    the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected
    sea level rise beyond 2100.  There is little evidence in global climate models
    of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially
    ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice
    loss is unstoppable and irreversible.  There is low confidence in assessing the
    evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century
    because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse
    beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.  Sustained
    mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass
    loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained global mean
    warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland
    ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current
    estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C but less than
    about 4°C of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt
    and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based sectors
    of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current
    evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment.  Within
    the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium
    to high emission scenarios  pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale
    change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater
    ecosystems, including wetlands, as well as warm water coral reefs . Examples that
    could substantially amplify climate change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system
    and the Amazon forest.  A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain
    with continued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are projected
    to become a net emitter of carbon with a loss of 180 to 920 GtCO2 under RCP8.5
    over the 21st century .
  - 'Characteristics of adaptation pathways  Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate
    change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater
    magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the
    context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate
    adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation
    can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security
    of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and
    in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach
    for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction
    and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages
    with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation
    research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration
    of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based,
    institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis,
    optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric
    evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider
    policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of
    specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable
    development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and
    benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation
    planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal
    values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances,
    social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes.
    Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous
    peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for
    adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing
    adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases
    the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and
    policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through
    complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National
    governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments,
    for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification
    and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support.
    Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical
    to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities,
    households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A
    first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability
    and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate
    change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning,
    including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development
    and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing
    short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result
    in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group
    in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example,
    enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection
    measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits
    and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation
    planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the
    following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination
    of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of
    risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and
    limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient
    research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to
    maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process
    can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes
    .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding
    adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable
    risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible
    or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable
    risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate
    change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take
    advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease
    with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of
    the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the
    basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence
    is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute
    a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural
    norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems
    to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be
    alleviated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable
    prospects for avoiding intolerable risks.  Transformations in economic, social,
    technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote
    sustainable development. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes
    to existing systems and structures without considering transformational change
    may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure
    to protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray increasing
    costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using ecosystem services
    to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and in the future. Transformational
    adaptation can include introduction of new technologies or practices, formation
    of new financial structures or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales
    or magnitudes and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation
    of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned
    paradigms and consequently may place new and increased demands on governance structures
    to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible
    equity and ethical implications: transformational adaptation pathways are enhanced
    by iterative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation. At the national
    level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country’s
    own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance
    with its national circumstances and priorities.  Building adaptive capacity is
    crucial for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options . Successful
    adaptation requires not only identifying adaptation options and assessing their
    costs and benefits, but also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural
    systems . This can involve complex governance challenges and new institutions
    and institutional arrangements.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs
    exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses;
    interactions occur both within and across regions . Increasing efforts to mitigate
    and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly
    at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools
    to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions
    with co-benefits include improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources,
    leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants;
    reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and
    recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems
    for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.'
  2.3b:
  - 'Future risks and impacts caused  by a changing climate Climate change will amplify
    existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly
    distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities
    in countries at all levels of development. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase
    the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people, species
    and ecosystems. Continued high emissions would lead to mostly negative impacts
    for biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic development and amplify risks
    for livelihoods and for food and human security. Risk of climate-related impacts
    results from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability
    and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising
    rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied
    by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases,
    irreversible detrimental impacts. Future climate change will amplify existing
    climate-related risks and create new risks.  Key risks are potentially severe
    impacts relevant to understanding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
    climate system. Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability
    of societies and systems exposed, or both. Their identification is based on large
    magnitude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts;
    persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks. Some
    risks are particularly relevant for individual regions, while others are global.
    For risk assessment it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts,
    including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often
    increase with temperature and are sometimes more directly linked to other dimensions
    of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well as the magnitudes and
    rates of ocean acidification and sea level rise .  Key risks that span sectors
    and regions include the following : 1. Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted
    livelihoods resulting from storm surges, sea level rise and coastal flooding;
    inland flooding in some urban regions; and periods of extreme heat. 2. Systemic
    risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks
    and critical services. 3. Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural
    livelihoods and income, particularly for poorer populations. 4. Risk of loss of
    ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, functions and services. The overall
    risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and
    magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. Some risks are considerable
    even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. Many
    global risks are high to very high for global temperature increases of 4°C or
    more. These risks include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened
    systems, the extinction of many species, large risks to food security and compromised
    normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas
    for parts of the year, due to the combination of high temperature and humidity.
    The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible
    change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds
    in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with
    rising temperature.  Adaptation can substantially reduce the risks of climate
    change impacts, but greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the
    likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits . The potential for adaptation, as well
    as constraints and limits to adaptation, varies among sectors, regions, communities
    and ecosystems. The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely linked
    to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances. See Figure 2.4 and Table
    2.3, along with Topics 3 and 4.'
  - Climate change beyond 2100,  irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of
    climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if
    anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or
    irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming
    will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures
    will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after
    a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions . A large fraction of
    anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a
    multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal
    of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Stabilization of global average
    surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate
    system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures
    and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales that
    will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global
    surface temperature has been stabilized.  Ocean acidification will continue for
    centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems
    , and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes.  Global mean
    sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100. The few available
    analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above
    the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline
    and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing
    that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below
    1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by
    2300 . There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid
    ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate
    the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected
    sea level rise beyond 2100.  There is little evidence in global climate models
    of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially
    ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice
    loss is unstoppable and irreversible.  There is low confidence in assessing the
    evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century
    because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse
    beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.  Sustained
    mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass
    loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained global mean
    warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland
    ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current
    estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C but less than
    about 4°C of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt
    and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based sectors
    of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current
    evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment.  Within
    the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium
    to high emission scenarios  pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale
    change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater
    ecosystems, including wetlands, as well as warm water coral reefs . Examples that
    could substantially amplify climate change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system
    and the Amazon forest.  A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain
    with continued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are projected
    to become a net emitter of carbon with a loss of 180 to 920 GtCO2 under RCP8.5
    over the 21st century .
  2.3c:
  - Ecosystems and their services in the oceans,  along coasts, on land and in freshwater
    Risks of harmful impacts on ecosystems and human systems increase with the rates
    and magnitudes of warming, ocean acidification, sea level rise and other dimensions
    of climate change. Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that
    natural global climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate
    change caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the
    past millions of years on land and in the oceans. Many plant and animal species
    will be unable to adapt locally or move fast enough during the 21st century to
    track suitable climates under mid- and high range rates of climate change . Coral
    reefs and polar ecosystems are highly vulnerable.  A large fraction of terrestrial,
    freshwater and marine species faces increased extinction risk due to climate change
    during and beyond the 21st century, especially as climate change interacts with
    other stressors. Extinction risk is increased relative to pre-industrial and present
    periods, under all RCP scenarios, as a result of both the magnitude and rate of
    climate change . Extinctions will be driven by several climate-associated drivers  and
    the interactions among these drivers and their interaction with simultaneous habitat
    modification, over-exploitation of stocks, pollution, eutrophication and invasive
    species.  Global marine species redistribution and marine biodiversity reduction
    in sensitive regions, under climate change, will challenge the sustained provision
    of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services, especially at low latitudes
    . By the mid-21st century, under 2°C global warming relative to pre-industrial
    temperatures, shifts in the geographical range of marine species will cause species
    richness and fisheries catch potential to increase, on average, at mid and high
    latitudes  and to decrease at tropical latitudes and in semi-enclosed seas. The
    progressive expansion of Oxygen Minimum Zones and anoxic ‘dead zones’ in the oceans
    will further constrain fish habitats. Open-ocean net primary production is projected
    to redistribute and to decrease globally, by 2100, under all RCP scenarios. Climate
    change adds to the threats of over-fishing and other non-climatic stressors .  Marine
    ecosystems, especially coral reefs and polar ecosystems, are at risk from ocean
    acidification. Ocean acidification has impacts on the physiology, behaviour and
    population dynamics of organisms. The impacts on individual species and the number
    of species affected in species groups increase from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5. Highly calcified
    molluscs, echinoderms and reef-building corals are more sensitive than crustaceans
    and fishes. Ocean acidification acts together with other global changes  and with
    local changes , leading to interactive, complex and amplified impacts for species
    and ecosystems.  Carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere is susceptible to
    loss to the atmosphere as a result of climate change, deforestation and ecosystem
    degradation. The aspects of climate change with direct effects on stored terrestrial
    carbon include high temperatures, drought and windstorms; indirect effects include
    increased risk of fires, pest and disease outbreaks. Increased tree mortality
    and associated forest dieback is projected to occur in many regions over the 21st
    century, posing risks for carbon storage, biodiversity, wood production, water
    quality, amenity and economic activity. There is a high risk of substantial carbon
    and methane emissions as a result of permafrost thawing.  Coastal systems and
    low-lying areas will increasingly experience submergence, flooding and erosion
    throughout the 21st century and beyond, due to sea level rise. The population
    and assets projected to be exposed to coastal risks as well as human pressures
    on coastal ecosystems will increase significantly in the coming decades due to
    population growth, economic development and urbanization. Climatic and non-climatic
    drivers affecting coral reefs will erode habitats, increase coastline exposure
    to waves and storms and degrade environmental features important to fisheries
    and tourism. Some low-lying developing countries and small island states are expected
    to face very high impacts that could have associated damage and adaptation costs
    of several percentage points of gross domestic product .
  - Water, food and urban systems, human  health, security and livelihoods The fractions
    of the global population that will experience water scarcity and be affected by
    major river floods are projected to increase with the level of warming in the
    21st century .  Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce renewable
    surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions, intensifying
    competition for water among sectors . In presently dry regions, the frequency
    of droughts will likely increase by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5.
    In contrast, water resources are projected to increase at high latitudes. The
    interaction of increased temperature; increased sediment, nutrient and pollutant
    loadings from heavy rainfall; increased concentrations of pollutants during droughts;
    and disruption of treatment facilities during floods will reduce raw water quality
    and pose risks to drinking water quality.  All aspects of food security are potentially
    affected by climate change, including food production, access, use and price stability.
    For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without
    adaptation is projected to negatively impact production at local temperature increases
    of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may
    benefit. Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and adaptation scenarios,
    with about 10% of projections for the 2030–2049 period showing yield gains of
    more than 10%, and about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than
    25%, compared with the late 20th century. Global temperature increases of ~4°C
    or more above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand,
    would pose large risks to food security, both globally and regionally. The relationship
    between global and regional warming is explained in 2.2.1.  Until mid-century,
    projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health
    problems that already exist. Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected
    to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing
    countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change .
    Health impacts include greater likelihood of injury and death due to more intense
    heat waves and fires, increased risks from foodborne and waterborne diseases and
    loss of work capacity and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations
    . Risks of undernutrition in poor regions will increase . Risks from vector-borne
    diseases are projected to generally increase with warming, due to the extension
    of the infection area and season, despite reductions in some areas that become
    too hot for disease vectors. Globally, the magnitude and severity of negative
    impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts . By 2100 for RCP8.5, the
    combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year
    is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and
    working outdoors.  In urban areas, climate change is projected to increase risks
    for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress,
    storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air
    pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges. These risks
    will be amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living
    in exposed areas.  Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water
    availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes,
    including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the
    world . These impacts will disproportionately affect the welfare of the poor in
    rural areas, such as female-headed households and those with limited access to
    land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure and education.  Aggregate economic
    losses accelerate with increasing temperature, but global economic impacts from
    climate change are currently difficult to estimate. With recognized limitations,
    the existing incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for warming
    of ~2.5°C above pre-industrial levels are 0.2 to 2.0% of income . Changes in population,
    age structure, income, technology, relative prices, lifestyle, regulation and
    governance are projected to have relatively larger impacts than climate change,
    for most economic sectors. More severe and/or frequent weather hazards are projected
    to increase disaster-related losses and loss variability, posing challenges for
    affordable insurance, particularly in developing countries. International dimensions
    such as trade and relations among states are also important for understanding
    the risks of climate change at regional scales.  From a poverty perspective, climate
    change impacts are projected to slow down economic growth, make poverty reduction
    more difficult, further erode food security and prolong existing poverty traps
    and create new ones, the latter particularly in urban areas and emerging hotspots
    of hunger . Climate change impacts are expected to exacerbate poverty in most
    developing countries and create new poverty pockets in countries with increasing
    inequality, in both developed and developing countries .  Climate change is projected
    to increase displacement of people . Displacement risk increases when populations
    that lack the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme
    weather events, such as floods and droughts. Expanding opportunities for mobility
    can reduce vulnerability for such populations. Changes in migration patterns can
    be responses to both extreme weather events and longer term climate variability
    and change, and migration can also be an effective adaptation strategy.  Climate
    change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflict by amplifying well-documented
    drivers of these conflicts, such as poverty and economic shocks. Multiple lines
    of evidence relate climate variability to some forms of conflict.
  2.3e:
  - Water, food and urban systems, human  health, security and livelihoods The fractions
    of the global population that will experience water scarcity and be affected by
    major river floods are projected to increase with the level of warming in the
    21st century .  Climate change over the 21st century is projected to reduce renewable
    surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions, intensifying
    competition for water among sectors . In presently dry regions, the frequency
    of droughts will likely increase by the end of the 21st century under RCP8.5.
    In contrast, water resources are projected to increase at high latitudes. The
    interaction of increased temperature; increased sediment, nutrient and pollutant
    loadings from heavy rainfall; increased concentrations of pollutants during droughts;
    and disruption of treatment facilities during floods will reduce raw water quality
    and pose risks to drinking water quality.  All aspects of food security are potentially
    affected by climate change, including food production, access, use and price stability.
    For wheat, rice and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without
    adaptation is projected to negatively impact production at local temperature increases
    of 2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may
    benefit. Projected impacts vary across crops and regions and adaptation scenarios,
    with about 10% of projections for the 2030–2049 period showing yield gains of
    more than 10%, and about 10% of projections showing yield losses of more than
    25%, compared with the late 20th century. Global temperature increases of ~4°C
    or more above late 20th century levels, combined with increasing food demand,
    would pose large risks to food security, both globally and regionally. The relationship
    between global and regional warming is explained in 2.2.1.  Until mid-century,
    projected climate change will impact human health mainly by exacerbating health
    problems that already exist. Throughout the 21st century, climate change is expected
    to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions and especially in developing
    countries with low income, as compared to a baseline without climate change .
    Health impacts include greater likelihood of injury and death due to more intense
    heat waves and fires, increased risks from foodborne and waterborne diseases and
    loss of work capacity and reduced labour productivity in vulnerable populations
    . Risks of undernutrition in poor regions will increase . Risks from vector-borne
    diseases are projected to generally increase with warming, due to the extension
    of the infection area and season, despite reductions in some areas that become
    too hot for disease vectors. Globally, the magnitude and severity of negative
    impacts will increasingly outweigh positive impacts . By 2100 for RCP8.5, the
    combination of high temperature and humidity in some areas for parts of the year
    is expected to compromise common human activities, including growing food and
    working outdoors.  In urban areas, climate change is projected to increase risks
    for people, assets, economies and ecosystems, including risks from heat stress,
    storms and extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides, air
    pollution, drought, water scarcity, sea level rise and storm surges. These risks
    will be amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure and services or living
    in exposed areas.  Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water
    availability and supply, food security, infrastructure and agricultural incomes,
    including shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the
    world . These impacts will disproportionately affect the welfare of the poor in
    rural areas, such as female-headed households and those with limited access to
    land, modern agricultural inputs, infrastructure and education.  Aggregate economic
    losses accelerate with increasing temperature, but global economic impacts from
    climate change are currently difficult to estimate. With recognized limitations,
    the existing incomplete estimates of global annual economic losses for warming

  2.4a:
  - Climate change beyond 2100,  irreversibility and abrupt changes Many aspects of
    climate change and its associated impacts will continue for centuries, even if
    anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are stopped. The risks of abrupt or
    irreversible changes increase as the magnitude of the warming increases. Warming
    will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface temperatures
    will remain approximately constant at elevated levels for many centuries after
    a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions . A large fraction of
    anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on a
    multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal
    of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.  Stabilization of global average
    surface temperature does not imply stabilization for all aspects of the climate
    system. Shifting biomes, re-equilibrating soil carbon, ice sheets, ocean temperatures
    and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic long timescales that
    will result in ongoing changes for hundreds to thousands of years after global
    surface temperature has been stabilized.  Ocean acidification will continue for
    centuries if CO2 emissions continue, it will strongly affect marine ecosystems
    , and the impact will be exacerbated by rising temperature extremes.  Global mean
    sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100. The few available
    analyses that go beyond 2100 indicate sea level rise to be less than 1 m above
    the pre-industrial level by 2300 for GHG concentrations that peak and decline
    and remain below 500 ppm CO2-eq, as in scenario RCP2.6. For a radiative forcing
    that corresponds to a CO2-eq concentration in 2100 that is above 700 ppm but below
    1500 ppm, as in scenario RCP8.5, the projected rise is 1 m to more than 3 m by
    2300 . There is low confidence in the available models’ ability to project solid
    ice discharge from the Antarctic ice sheet. Hence, these models likely underestimate
    the Antarctica ice sheet contribution, resulting in an underestimation of projected
    sea level rise beyond 2100.  There is little evidence in global climate models
    of a tipping point or critical threshold in the transition from a perennially
    ice-covered to a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean, beyond which further sea-ice
    loss is unstoppable and irreversible.  There is low confidence in assessing the
    evolution of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation beyond the 21st century
    because of the limited number of analyses and equivocal results. However, a collapse
    beyond the 21st century for large sustained warming cannot be excluded.  Sustained
    mass loss by ice sheets would cause larger sea level rise, and part of the mass
    loss might be irreversible. There is high confidence that sustained global mean
    warming greater than a threshold would lead to the near-complete loss of the Greenland
    ice sheet over a millennium or more, causing a sea level rise of up to 7 m. Current
    estimates indicate that the threshold is greater than about 1°C but less than
    about 4°C of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures. Abrupt
    and irreversible ice loss from a potential instability of marine-based sectors
    of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to climate forcing is possible, but current
    evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment.  Within
    the 21st century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium
    to high emission scenarios  pose a high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale
    change in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater
    ecosystems, including wetlands, as well as warm water coral reefs . Examples that
    could substantially amplify climate change are the boreal-tundra Arctic system
    and the Amazon forest.  A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually certain
    with continued rise in global temperatures. Current permafrost areas are projected
    to become a net emitter of carbon with a loss of 180 to 920 GtCO2 under RCP8.5
    over the 21st century .

  3.1a:
  - 'Foundations of decision-making  about climate change Effective decision-making
    to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of analytical
    approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits, recognizing the importance
    of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assessments
    and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. Sustainable development
    and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects
    of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity,
    including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contributions to the
    accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face
    varying challenges and circumstances and have different capacities to address
    mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice
    and fairness and are necessary to achieve sustainable development and poverty
    eradication. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed
    and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from
    the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging impacts
    are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Both adaptation and
    mitigation can have distributional effects locally, nationally and internationally,
    depending on who pays and who benefits. The process of decision-making about climate
    change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of all those
    affected, is also a concern of justice.  Effective mitigation will not be achieved
    if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Climate change
    has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because
    most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent affect
    other agents. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are

  - Interaction among mitigation, adaptation  and sustainable development Climate
    change is a threat to equitable and sustainable development. Adaptation, mitigation
    and sustainable development are closely related, with potential for synergies
    and trade-offs. Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and sustainable
    development. Some climate-related impacts on development are already being observed.
    Climate change is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social
    and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and constraining
    possible development paths for all. Development along current global pathways
    can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability, further eroding the basis for
    sustainable development.  Aligning climate policy with sustainable development
    requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation. Interaction among adaptation,
    mitigation and sustainable development occurs both within and across regions and
    scales, often in the context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding
    to climate change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs,
    have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from other development
    priorities, including poverty eradication.  Both adaptation and mitigation can
    bring substantial co-benefits . Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved
    air quality; enhanced energy security, reduced energy and water consumption in
    urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture
    and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem
    services.  Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-resilient
    pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve
    livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management.
    Prospects for climate-resilient pathways are related fundamentally to what the
    world accomplishes with climate change mitigation. Since mitigation reduces the
    rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available
    for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several
    decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient
    pathways in the future.

  3.2b:
  - Climate change risks reduced by  adaptation and mitigation Without additional
    mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming
    by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe,
    widespread and irreversible impacts globally. Mitigation involves some level of
    co-benefits and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve
    the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from
    climate change, increasing the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts. The
    risks of climate change, adaptation and mitigation differ in nature, timescale,
    magnitude and persistence. Risks from adaptation include maladaptation and negative
    ancillary impacts. Risks from mitigation include possible adverse side effects
    of large-scale deployment of low-carbon technology options and economic costs.
    Climate change risks may persist for millennia and can involve very high risk
    of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibilities combined with
    limited adaptive capacity. In contrast, the stringency of climate policies can
    be adjusted much more quickly in response to observed consequences and costs and
    create lower risks of irreversible consequences.  Mitigation and adaptation are
    complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts. They interact
    with one another and reduce risks over different timescales . Benefits from adaptation
    can already be realized in addressing current risks and can be realized in the
    future for addressing emerging risks. Adaptation has the potential to reduce climate
    change impacts over the next few decades, while mitigation has relatively little
    influence on climate outcomes over this timescale. Near-term and longerterm mitigation
    and adaptation, as well as development pathways, will determine the risks of climate
    change beyond mid-century. The potential for adaptation differs across sectors
    and will be limited by institutional and capacity constraints, increasing the
    long-term benefits of mitigation. The level of mitigation will influence the rate
    and magnitude of climate change, and greater rates and magnitude of climate change
    increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits.  Without additional mitigation
    efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the
    end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread
    and irreversible impacts globally . Estimates of warming in 2100 without additional
    climate mitigation efforts are from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared with pre-industrial
    levels; the range is 2.5°C to 7.8°C when using the 5th to 95th percentile range
    of the median climate response. The risks associated with temperatures at or above
    4°C include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial
    species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, consequential
    constraints on common human activities, increased likelihood of triggering tipping
    points  and limited potential for adaptation in some cases . Some risks of climate
    change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with
    extreme weather events, are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above
    pre-industrial levels.  Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades
    can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting warming in the second
    half of the 21st century and beyond . Global mean surface warming is largely determined
    by cumulative emissions, which are, in turn, linked to emissions over different
    timescales. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern would imply a limit for
    cumulative emissions of CO2. Such a limit would require that global net emissions
    of CO2 eventually decrease to zero. Reducing risks of climate change through mitigation
    would involve substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades. But
    some risks from residual damages are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation.
    A subset of relevant climate change risks has been estimated using aggregate economic
    indicators. Such economic estimates have important limitations and are therefore
    a useful but insufficient basis for decision-making on long-term mitigation targets.  Mitigation
    involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these risks do not involve the
    same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from
    climate change . Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C or even
    3°C compared with pre-industrial temperatures involve large-scale changes in energy
    systems and potentially land use over the coming decades. Associated risks include
    those linked to large-scale deployment of technology options for producing low-carbon
    energy, the potential for high aggregate economic costs of mitigation and impacts
    on vulnerable countries and industries. Other risks and co-benefits are associated
    with human health, food security, energy security, poverty reduction, biodiversity
    conservation, water availability, income distribution, efficiency of taxation
    systems, labour supply and employment, urban sprawl, fossil fuel export revenues
    and the economic growth of developing countries.  Inertia in the economic and
    climate systems and the possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change
    increase the benefits of near-term mitigation efforts. The actions taken today
    affect the options available in the future to reduce emissions, limit temperature
    change and adapt to climate change. Near-term choices can create, amplify or limit
    significant elements of lock-in that are important for decision-making. Lock-ins
    and irreversibilities occur in the climate system due to large inertia in some
    of its components such as heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth leading
    to continued ocean warming for centuries regardless of emission scenario and the
    irreversibility of a large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting
    from CO2 emissions on a multi-century to millennial timescale unless CO2 were
    to be removed from the atmosphere through large-scale human interventions over
    a sustained period . Irreversibilities in socio-economic and biological systems
    also result from infrastructure development and long-lived products and from climate
    change impacts, such as species extinction. The larger potential for irreversibility
    and pervasive impacts from climate change risks than from mitigation risks increases
    the benefit of shortterm mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or
    constraints on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase
    the long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred in
    the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given level.
  - Trade-offs, synergies and integrated responses  There are many opportunities to
    link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through
    integrated responses. Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suitable
    governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond. A growing evidence base
    indicates close links between adaptation and mitigation, their co-benefits and
    adverse side effects, and recognizes sustainable development as the overarching
    context for climate policy . Developing tools to address these linkages is critical
    to the success of climate policy in the context of sustainable development. This
    section presents examples of integrated responses in specific policy arenas, as
    well as some of the factors that promote or impede policies aimed at multiple
    objectives. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an
    increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health,
    water, energy, land use and biodiversity. Mitigation can support the achievement
    of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security,
    environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and sustainable development,
    although there can also be negative effects. Adaptation measures also have the
    potential to deliver mitigation co-benefits, and vice versa, and support other
    societal goals, though trade-offs can also arise.  Integration of adaptation and
    mitigation into planning and decision-making can create synergies with sustainable
    development. Synergies and trade-offs among mitigation and adaptation policies
    and policies advancing other societal goals can be substantial, although sometimes
    difficult to quantify especially in welfare terms. A multi-objective approach
    to policy-making can help manage these synergies and trade-offs. Policies advancing
    multiple goals may also attract greater support.  Effective integrated responses
    depend on suitable tools and governance structures, as well as adequate capacity
    . Managing trade-offs and synergies is challenging and requires tools to help
    understand interactions and support decision-making at local and regional scales.
    Integrated responses also depend on governance that enables coordination across
    scales and sectors, supported by appropriate institutions. Developing and implementing
    suitable tools and governance structures often requires upgrading the human and
    institutional capacity to design and deploy integrated responses.  An integrated
    approach to energy planning and implementation that explicitly assesses the potential
    for co-benefits and the presence of adverse side effects can capture complementarities
    across multiple climate, social and environmental objectives . There are strong
    interactive effects across various energy policy objectives, such as energy security,
    air quality, health and energy access and between a range of social and environmental
    objectives and climate mitigation objectives . An integrated approach can be assisted
    by tools such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria
    analysis and expected utility theory. It also requires appropriate coordinating
    institutions.  Explicit consideration of interactions among water, food, energy
    and biological carbon sequestration plays an important role in supporting effective
    decisions for climate resilient pathways . Both biofuel-based power generation
    and large-scale afforestation designed to mitigate climate change can reduce catchment
    run-off, which may conflict with alternative water uses for food production, human
    consumption or the maintenance of ecosystem function and services. Conversely,
    irrigation can increase the climate resilience of food and fibre production but
    reduces water availability for other uses.  An integrated response to urbanization
    provides substantial opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions
    and more sustainable development. Urban areas account for more than half of global
    primary energy use and energy-related CO2 emissions and contain a high proportion
    of the population and economic activities at risk from climate change. In rapidly
    growing and urbanizing regions, mitigation strategies based on spatial planning
    and efficient infrastructure supply can avoid the lock-in of high emission patterns.
    Mixed-use zoning, transport-oriented development, increased density and co-located
    jobs and homes can reduce direct and indirect energy use across sectors. Compact
    development of urban spaces and intelligent densification can preserve land carbon
    stocks and land for agriculture and bioenergy. Reduced energy and water consumption
    in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water are examples of mitigation
    actions with adaptation benefits. Building resilient infrastructure systems can
    reduce vulnerability of urban settlements and cities to coastal flooding, sea
    level rise and other climate-induced stresses.

  - 'Future risks and impacts caused  by a changing climate Climate change will amplify
    existing risks and create new risks for natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly
    distributed and are generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities
    in countries at all levels of development. Increasing magnitudes of warming increase
    the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people, species
    and ecosystems. Continued high emissions would lead to mostly negative impacts
    for biodiversity, ecosystem services and economic development and amplify risks
    for livelihoods and for food and human security. Risk of climate-related impacts
    results from the interaction of climate-related hazards with the vulnerability
    and exposure of human and natural systems, including their ability to adapt. Rising
    rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, accompanied
    by ocean acidification, increase the risk of severe, pervasive, and in some cases,
    irreversible detrimental impacts. Future climate change will amplify existing
    climate-related risks and create new risks.  Key risks are potentially severe
    impacts relevant to understanding dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
    climate system. Risks are considered key due to high hazard or high vulnerability
    of societies and systems exposed, or both. Their identification is based on large
    magnitude or high probability of impacts; irreversibility or timing of impacts;
    persistent vulnerability or exposure; or limited potential to reduce risks. Some
    risks are particularly relevant for individual regions, while others are global.
    For risk assessment it is important to evaluate the widest possible range of impacts,
    including low-probability outcomes with large consequences. Risk levels often
    increase with temperature and are sometimes more directly linked to other dimensions
    of climate change, such as the rate of warming, as well as the magnitudes and
    rates of ocean acidification and sea level rise .  Key risks that span sectors
    and regions include the following : 1. Risk of severe ill-health and disrupted
    livelihoods resulting from storm surges, sea level rise and coastal flooding;
    inland flooding in some urban regions; and periods of extreme heat. 2. Systemic
    risks due to extreme weather events leading to breakdown of infrastructure networks
    and critical services. 3. Risk of food and water insecurity and loss of rural
    livelihoods and income, particularly for poorer populations. 4. Risk of loss of
    ecosystems, biodiversity and ecosystem goods, functions and services. The overall
    risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the rate and
    magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. Some risks are considerable
    even at 1°C global mean temperature increase above pre-industrial levels. Many
    global risks are high to very high for global temperature increases of 4°C or
    more. These risks include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened
    systems, the extinction of many species, large risks to food security and compromised
    normal human activities, including growing food or working outdoors in some areas
    for parts of the year, due to the combination of high temperature and humidity.
    The precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible
    change remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds
    in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with
    rising temperature.  Adaptation can substantially reduce the risks of climate
    change impacts, but greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the
    likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits . The potential for adaptation, as well
    as constraints and limits to adaptation, varies among sectors, regions, communities
    and ecosystems. The scope for adaptation changes over time and is closely linked
    to socio-economic development pathways and circumstances. See Figure 2.4 and Table
    2.3, along with Topics 3 and 4.'
  - Climate change risks reduced by  adaptation and mitigation Without additional
    mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming
    by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe,
    widespread and irreversible impacts globally. Mitigation involves some level of
    co-benefits and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve
    the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from
    climate change, increasing the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts. The
    risks of climate change, adaptation and mitigation differ in nature, timescale,
    magnitude and persistence. Risks from adaptation include maladaptation and negative
    ancillary impacts. Risks from mitigation include possible adverse side effects
    of large-scale deployment of low-carbon technology options and economic costs.
    Climate change risks may persist for millennia and can involve very high risk
    of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibilities combined with
    limited adaptive capacity. In contrast, the stringency of climate policies can
    be adjusted much more quickly in response to observed consequences and costs and
    create lower risks of irreversible consequences.  Mitigation and adaptation are
    complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts. They interact
    with one another and reduce risks over different timescales . Benefits from adaptation
    can already be realized in addressing current risks and can be realized in the
    future for addressing emerging risks. Adaptation has the potential to reduce climate
    change impacts over the next few decades, while mitigation has relatively little
    influence on climate outcomes over this timescale. Near-term and longerterm mitigation
    and adaptation, as well as development pathways, will determine the risks of climate
    change beyond mid-century. The potential for adaptation differs across sectors
    and will be limited by institutional and capacity constraints, increasing the
    long-term benefits of mitigation. The level of mitigation will influence the rate
    and magnitude of climate change, and greater rates and magnitude of climate change
    increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits.  Without additional mitigation
    efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the
    end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread
    and irreversible impacts globally . Estimates of warming in 2100 without additional
    climate mitigation efforts are from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared with pre-industrial
    levels; the range is 2.5°C to 7.8°C when using the 5th to 95th percentile range
    of the median climate response. The risks associated with temperatures at or above
    4°C include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial
    species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, consequential
    constraints on common human activities, increased likelihood of triggering tipping
    points  and limited potential for adaptation in some cases . Some risks of climate
    change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with
    extreme weather events, are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above
    pre-industrial levels.  Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades
    can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting warming in the second
    half of the 21st century and beyond . Global mean surface warming is largely determined
    by cumulative emissions, which are, in turn, linked to emissions over different
    timescales. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern would imply a limit for
    cumulative emissions of CO2. Such a limit would require that global net emissions
    of CO2 eventually decrease to zero. Reducing risks of climate change through mitigation
    would involve substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades. But
    some risks from residual damages are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation.
    A subset of relevant climate change risks has been estimated using aggregate economic
    indicators. Such economic estimates have important limitations and are therefore
    a useful but insufficient basis for decision-making on long-term mitigation targets.  Mitigation
    involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these risks do not involve the
    same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from
    climate change . Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C or even
    3°C compared with pre-industrial temperatures involve large-scale changes in energy
    systems and potentially land use over the coming decades. Associated risks include
    those linked to large-scale deployment of technology options for producing low-carbon
    energy, the potential for high aggregate economic costs of mitigation and impacts
    on vulnerable countries and industries. Other risks and co-benefits are associated
    with human health, food security, energy security, poverty reduction, biodiversity
    conservation, water availability, income distribution, efficiency of taxation
    systems, labour supply and employment, urban sprawl, fossil fuel export revenues
    and the economic growth of developing countries.  Inertia in the economic and
    climate systems and the possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change
    increase the benefits of near-term mitigation efforts. The actions taken today
    affect the options available in the future to reduce emissions, limit temperature
    change and adapt to climate change. Near-term choices can create, amplify or limit
    significant elements of lock-in that are important for decision-making. Lock-ins
    and irreversibilities occur in the climate system due to large inertia in some
    of its components such as heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth leading
    to continued ocean warming for centuries regardless of emission scenario and the
    irreversibility of a large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting
    from CO2 emissions on a multi-century to millennial timescale unless CO2 were
    to be removed from the atmosphere through large-scale human interventions over
    a sustained period . Irreversibilities in socio-economic and biological systems
    also result from infrastructure development and long-lived products and from climate
    change impacts, such as species extinction. The larger potential for irreversibility
    and pervasive impacts from climate change risks than from mitigation risks increases
    the benefit of shortterm mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or
    constraints on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase
    the long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred in
    the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given level.
  - Characteristics of mitigation pathways  There are multiple mitigation pathways
    that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
    These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few
    decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by
    the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological,
    economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional
    mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower
    or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. Without
    additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global
    emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and
    economic activities. Global GHG emissions under most scenarios without additional
    mitigation  are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 21003520which
    is approximately between the 2100 emission levels in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways
    3621 . Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration
    levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Global
    mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above
    the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C
    to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty 3722 . The future scenarios do not
    account for possible changes in natural forcings in the climate system.  Many
    different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be
    used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. To evaluate possible pathways
    to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for
    this assessment, each of which describes different technological, socio-economic
    and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations
    in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the
    2100 forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concentration levels
    of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed.  Scenarios leading to CO2-eq
    concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming
    below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more
    likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
    unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.
    In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
    unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by
    2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the
    century and subsequently declines.  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm
    CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve temporary overshootof atmospheric concentrations,
    as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100. Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely
    on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide
    capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability
    and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies and methods are
    uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated
    with challenges and risks 3924 . CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without
    overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is
    more expensive.  Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions
    by mid-century through largescale changes in energy systems and possibly land
    use. Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less
    quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.
    Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by
    a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions
    levels near zero or below in 2100. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are
    characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and
    vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
    more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling
    of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear
    energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the
    year 2050. The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
    different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation and
    reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentrations of 500 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative
    to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming
    to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely
    than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
    by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between
    70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of
    emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood
    to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1.  Reducing
    emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. Emissions of nonCO2 gases, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) contributed
    about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases,
    near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However,
    some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions
    from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of
    most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
    scenarios. The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2
    climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies.  All
    current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude
    of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain
    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation
    trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below
    2°C relative to pre-industrial levels , but they do not preclude the option to
    meet this goal . The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
    scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels.  Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation
    vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency
    of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation
    immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all
    key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for
    estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs. Under these assumptions, mitigation
    scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including
    benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of mitigation —of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative
    to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than
    900% over the century . These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of
    consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative
    to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per
    year. In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies
    , mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
    . Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation
    costs in the medium- to long-term. Many models could not limit likely warming
    to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional
    mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such
    as bioenergy, CCS and their combination are limited .  Mitigation efforts and
    associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs
    can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves. In globally cost-effective
    scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the
    highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular
    effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have
    estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
    that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st
    century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
  3.2e:
  - Climate system responses  Climate system properties that determine the response
    to external forcing have been estimated both from climate models and from analysis
    of past and recent climate change. The equilibrium climate sensitivity 3325is
    likely in the range 1.5°C to 4.5°C, extremely unlikely less than 1°C, and very
    unlikely greater than 6°C.  Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global
    mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Multiple lines of evidence
    indicate a strong and consistent near-linear relationship across all scenarios
    considered between net cumulative CO2 emissions  and projected global temperature
    change to the year 2100. Past emissions and observed warming support this relationship
    within uncertainties. Any given level of warming is associated with a range of
    cumulative CO2 emissions , and therefore, for example, higher emissions in earlier
    decades imply lower emissions later.  The global mean peak surface temperature
    change per trillion tonnes of carbon emitted as CO2 is likely in the range of
    0.8°C to 2.5°C. This quantity, called the transient climate response to cumulative
    carbon emissions, is supported by both modelling and observational evidence and
    applies to cumulative emissions up to about 2000 GtC.  Warming caused by CO2 emissions
    is effectively irreversible over multi-century timescales unless measures are
    taken to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Ensuring CO2-induced warming remains
    likely less than 2°C requires cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic
    sources to remain below about 3650 GtCO2, over half of which were already emitted
    by 2011.  Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to
    less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66% would
    require total CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to be limited
    to about 2900 GtCO2 when accounting for non-CO2 forcing as in the RCP2.6 scenario,
    with a range of 2550 to 3150 GtCO2 arising from variations in non-CO2 climate
    drivers across the scenarios considered by WGIII. About 1900 [1650 to 2150] GtCO2
    were emitted by 2011, leaving about 1000 GtCO2 to be consistent with this temperature
    goal. Estimated total fossil carbon reserves exceed this remaining amount by a
    factor of 4 to 7, with resources much larger still.
  - Climate change risks reduced by  adaptation and mitigation Without additional
    mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming
    by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe,
    widespread and irreversible impacts globally. Mitigation involves some level of
    co-benefits and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve
    the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from
    climate change, increasing the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts. The
    risks of climate change, adaptation and mitigation differ in nature, timescale,
    magnitude and persistence. Risks from adaptation include maladaptation and negative
    ancillary impacts. Risks from mitigation include possible adverse side effects
    of large-scale deployment of low-carbon technology options and economic costs.
    Climate change risks may persist for millennia and can involve very high risk
    of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibilities combined with
    limited adaptive capacity. In contrast, the stringency of climate policies can
    be adjusted much more quickly in response to observed consequences and costs and
    create lower risks of irreversible consequences.  Mitigation and adaptation are
    complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts. They interact
    with one another and reduce risks over different timescales . Benefits from adaptation
    can already be realized in addressing current risks and can be realized in the
    future for addressing emerging risks. Adaptation has the potential to reduce climate
    change impacts over the next few decades, while mitigation has relatively little
    influence on climate outcomes over this timescale. Near-term and longerterm mitigation
    and adaptation, as well as development pathways, will determine the risks of climate
    change beyond mid-century. The potential for adaptation differs across sectors
    and will be limited by institutional and capacity constraints, increasing the
    long-term benefits of mitigation. The level of mitigation will influence the rate
    and magnitude of climate change, and greater rates and magnitude of climate change
    increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits.  Without additional mitigation
    efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the
    end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread
    and irreversible impacts globally . Estimates of warming in 2100 without additional
    climate mitigation efforts are from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared with pre-industrial

    species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, consequential

    the benefit of shortterm mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or
    constraints on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase
    the long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred in
    the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given level.
  - Characteristics of mitigation pathways  There are multiple mitigation pathways
    that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
    These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few
    decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by
    the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological,
    economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional
    mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower
    or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. Without
    additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global
    emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and
    economic activities. Global GHG emissions under most scenarios without additional
    mitigation  are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 21003520which
    is approximately between the 2100 emission levels in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways
    3621 . Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration
    levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Global
    mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above
    the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C
    to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty 3722 . The future scenarios do not
    account for possible changes in natural forcings in the climate system.  Many
    different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be
    used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. To evaluate possible pathways
    to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for
    this assessment, each of which describes different technological, socio-economic
    and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations
    in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the
    2100 forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concentration levels
    of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed.  Scenarios leading to CO2-eq
    concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming
    below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more
    likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
    unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.
    In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
    unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by
    2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the
    century and subsequently declines.  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm
    CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve temporary overshootof atmospheric concentrations,
    as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100. Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely
    on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide
    capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability
    and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies and methods are
    uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated
    with challenges and risks 3924 . CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without
    overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is
    more expensive.  Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions
    by mid-century through largescale changes in energy systems and possibly land
    use. Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less
    quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.
    Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by
    a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions
    levels near zero or below in 2100. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are
    characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and
    vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
    more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling
    of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear
    energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the
    year 2050. The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
    different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation and
    reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentrations of 500 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative
    to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming
    to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely
    than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
    by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between
    70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of
    emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood
    to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1.  Reducing
    emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. Emissions of nonCO2 gases, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) contributed
    about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases,
    near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However,
    some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions
    from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of
    most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
    scenarios. The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2
    climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies.  All
    current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude
    of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain
    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation
    trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below
    2°C relative to pre-industrial levels , but they do not preclude the option to
    meet this goal . The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
    scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels.  Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation
    vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency
    of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation
    immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all
    key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for
    estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs. Under these assumptions, mitigation
    scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including
    benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of mitigation —of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative
    to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than
    900% over the century . These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of
    consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative
    to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per
    year. In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies
    , mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
    . Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation
    costs in the medium- to long-term. Many models could not limit likely warming
    to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional
    mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such
    as bioenergy, CCS and their combination are limited .  Mitigation efforts and
    associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs
    can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves. In globally cost-effective
    scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the
    highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular
    effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have
    estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
    that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st
    century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
  3.2f:
  - Climate change risks reduced by  adaptation and mitigation Without additional
    mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming
    by the end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe,
    widespread and irreversible impacts globally. Mitigation involves some level of
    co-benefits and of risks due to adverse side effects, but these risks do not involve
    the same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from
    climate change, increasing the benefits from near-term mitigation efforts. The
    risks of climate change, adaptation and mitigation differ in nature, timescale,
    magnitude and persistence. Risks from adaptation include maladaptation and negative
    ancillary impacts. Risks from mitigation include possible adverse side effects
    of large-scale deployment of low-carbon technology options and economic costs.
    Climate change risks may persist for millennia and can involve very high risk
    of severe impacts and the presence of significant irreversibilities combined with
    limited adaptive capacity. In contrast, the stringency of climate policies can
    be adjusted much more quickly in response to observed consequences and costs and
    create lower risks of irreversible consequences.  Mitigation and adaptation are
    complementary approaches for reducing risks of climate change impacts. They interact
    with one another and reduce risks over different timescales . Benefits from adaptation
    can already be realized in addressing current risks and can be realized in the
    future for addressing emerging risks. Adaptation has the potential to reduce climate
    change impacts over the next few decades, while mitigation has relatively little
    influence on climate outcomes over this timescale. Near-term and longerterm mitigation
    and adaptation, as well as development pathways, will determine the risks of climate
    change beyond mid-century. The potential for adaptation differs across sectors
    and will be limited by institutional and capacity constraints, increasing the
    long-term benefits of mitigation. The level of mitigation will influence the rate
    and magnitude of climate change, and greater rates and magnitude of climate change
    increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits.  Without additional mitigation
    efforts beyond those in place today, and even with adaptation, warming by the
    end of the 21st century will lead to high to very high risk of severe, widespread
    and irreversible impacts globally . Estimates of warming in 2100 without additional
    climate mitigation efforts are from 3.7°C to 4.8°C compared with pre-industrial
    levels; the range is 2.5°C to 7.8°C when using the 5th to 95th percentile range
    of the median climate response. The risks associated with temperatures at or above
    4°C include severe and widespread impacts on unique and threatened systems, substantial
    species extinction, large risks to global and regional food security, consequential
    constraints on common human activities, increased likelihood of triggering tipping
    points  and limited potential for adaptation in some cases . Some risks of climate
    change, such as risks to unique and threatened systems and risks associated with
    extreme weather events, are moderate to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above
    pre-industrial levels.  Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades
    can substantially reduce risks of climate change by limiting warming in the second
    half of the 21st century and beyond . Global mean surface warming is largely determined
    by cumulative emissions, which are, in turn, linked to emissions over different
    timescales. Limiting risks across Reasons For Concern would imply a limit for
    cumulative emissions of CO2. Such a limit would require that global net emissions
    of CO2 eventually decrease to zero. Reducing risks of climate change through mitigation
    would involve substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades. But
    some risks from residual damages are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation.
    A subset of relevant climate change risks has been estimated using aggregate economic
    indicators. Such economic estimates have important limitations and are therefore
    a useful but insufficient basis for decision-making on long-term mitigation targets.  Mitigation
    involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these risks do not involve the
    same possibility of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts as risks from
    climate change . Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C or even
    3°C compared with pre-industrial temperatures involve large-scale changes in energy
    systems and potentially land use over the coming decades. Associated risks include
    those linked to large-scale deployment of technology options for producing low-carbon
    energy, the potential for high aggregate economic costs of mitigation and impacts
    on vulnerable countries and industries. Other risks and co-benefits are associated
    with human health, food security, energy security, poverty reduction, biodiversity
    conservation, water availability, income distribution, efficiency of taxation
    systems, labour supply and employment, urban sprawl, fossil fuel export revenues
    and the economic growth of developing countries.  Inertia in the economic and
    climate systems and the possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change
    increase the benefits of near-term mitigation efforts. The actions taken today
    affect the options available in the future to reduce emissions, limit temperature
    change and adapt to climate change. Near-term choices can create, amplify or limit
    significant elements of lock-in that are important for decision-making. Lock-ins
    and irreversibilities occur in the climate system due to large inertia in some
    of its components such as heat transfer from the ocean surface to depth leading
    to continued ocean warming for centuries regardless of emission scenario and the
    irreversibility of a large fraction of anthropogenic climate change resulting
    from CO2 emissions on a multi-century to millennial timescale unless CO2 were
    to be removed from the atmosphere through large-scale human interventions over
    a sustained period . Irreversibilities in socio-economic and biological systems
    also result from infrastructure development and long-lived products and from climate
    change impacts, such as species extinction. The larger potential for irreversibility
    and pervasive impacts from climate change risks than from mitigation risks increases
    the benefit of shortterm mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or
    constraints on technological options limit the mitigation options and increase
    the long-term mitigation costs as well as other risks that would be incurred in
    the medium to long term to hold climate change impacts at a given level.
  - Characteristics of mitigation pathways  There are multiple mitigation pathways
    that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
    These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few
    decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by
    the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological,
    economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional
    mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower
    or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. Without
    additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global
    emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and
    economic activities. Global GHG emissions under most scenarios without additional
    mitigation  are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 21003520which
    is approximately between the 2100 emission levels in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways
    3621 . Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration
    levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Global
    mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above
    the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C
    to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty 3722 . The future scenarios do not
    account for possible changes in natural forcings in the climate system.  Many
    different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be
    used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. To evaluate possible pathways
    to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for
    this assessment, each of which describes different technological, socio-economic
    and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations
    in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the
    2100 forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concentration levels
    of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed.  Scenarios leading to CO2-eq
    concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming
    below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more
    likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
    unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.
    In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
    unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by
    2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the
    century and subsequently declines.  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm
    CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve temporary overshootof atmospheric concentrations,
    as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100. Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely
    on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide
    capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability
    and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies and methods are
    uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated
    with challenges and risks 3924 . CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without
    overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is
    more expensive.  Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions
    by mid-century through largescale changes in energy systems and possibly land
    use. Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less
    quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.
    Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by
    a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions
    levels near zero or below in 2100. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are
    characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and
    vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
    more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling
    of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear
    energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the
    year 2050. The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
    different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation and
    reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentrations of 500 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative
    to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming
    to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely
    than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
    by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between
    70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of
    emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood
    to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1.  Reducing
    emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. Emissions of nonCO2 gases, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) contributed
    about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases,
    near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However,
    some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions
    from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of
    most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
    scenarios. The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2
    climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies.  All
    current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude
    of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain
    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation
    trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below
    2°C relative to pre-industrial levels , but they do not preclude the option to
    meet this goal . The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
    scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels.  Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation
    vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency
    of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation
    immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all
    key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for
    estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs. Under these assumptions, mitigation
    scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including
    benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of mitigation —of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative
    to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than
    900% over the century . These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of
    consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative
    to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per
    year. In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies
    , mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
    . Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation
    costs in the medium- to long-term. Many models could not limit likely warming
    to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional
    mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such
    as bioenergy, CCS and their combination are limited .  Mitigation efforts and
    associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs
    can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves. In globally cost-effective
    scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the
    highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular
    effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have
    estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
    that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st
    century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
  3.3a:
  - 'Characteristics of adaptation pathways  Adaptation can reduce the risks of climate
    change impacts, but there are limits to its effectiveness, especially with greater
    magnitudes and rates of climate change. Taking a longer-term perspective, in the
    context of sustainable development, increases the likelihood that more immediate
    adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation
    can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security
    of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and
    in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach
    for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction
    and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages
    with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation
    research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration
    of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based,
    institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis,
    optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric
    evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider
    policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of
    specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable
    development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and
    benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation
    planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal
    values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances,
    social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes.
    Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous
    peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for
    adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing
    adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases
    the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and
    policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through
    complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National
    governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments,
    for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification
    and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support.
    Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical
    to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities,
    households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A
    first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability
    and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate
    change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning,
    including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development
    and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing
    short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result
    in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group
    in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example,
    enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection
    measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits
    and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation
    planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the
    following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination
    of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of
    risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and
    limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient
    research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to
    maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process
    can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes
    .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding
    adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable
    risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible
    or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable
    risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate
    change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take
    advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease
    with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of
    the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the
    basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence
    is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute
    a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural
    norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems
    to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be

    to protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray increasing

    to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and in the future. Transformational

    planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal
    values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances,

    Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous
    peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for
    adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing
    adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases
    the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and
    policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through
    complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National
    governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments,
    for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification
    and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support.
    Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical
    to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities,
    households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A
    first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability
    and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate
    change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning,
    including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development
    and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing
    short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result
    in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group
    in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example,
    enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection
    measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits
    and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation
    planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the
    following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination
    of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of
    risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and
    limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient
    research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to
    maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process
    can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes
    .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding
    adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable
    risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible
    or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable
    risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate
    change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take
    advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease
    with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of
    the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the
    basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence
    is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute

    adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness. Adaptation
    can contribute to the well-being of current and future populations, the security
    of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods, functions and services now and
    in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific, with no single approach
    for reducing risks appropriate across all settings . Effective risk reduction
    and adaptation strategies consider vulnerability and exposure and their linkages
    with socio-economic processes, sustainable development, and climate change. Adaptation
    research since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report has evolved from a dominant consideration
    of engineering and technological adaptation pathways to include more ecosystem-based,
    institutional and social measures. A previous focus on cost–benefit analysis,
    optimization and efficiency approaches has broadened with the development of multi-metric
    evaluations that include risk and uncertainty dimensions integrated within wider
    policy and ethical frameworks to assess tradeoffs and constraints. The range of
    specific adaptation measures has also expanded, as have the links to sustainable
    development. There are many studies on local and sectoral adaptation costs and
    benefits, but few global analyses and very low confidence in their results.  Adaptation
    planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent on societal
    values, objectives and risk perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests, circumstances,
    social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making processes.
    Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices, including indigenous
    peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are a major resource for
    adapting to climate change, but these have not been used consistently in existing
    adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge into practices increases
    the effectiveness of adaptation as do effective decision support, engagement and
    policy processes.  Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through
    complementary actions across levels, from individuals to governments. National
    governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments,
    for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification
    and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support.
    Local government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical
    to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities,
    households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.  A
    first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability
    and exposure to present climate variability, but some near-term responses to climate
    change may also limit future choices. Integration of adaptation into planning,
    including policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development
    and disaster risk reduction. However, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing
    short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result
    in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group
    in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. For example,
    enhanced protection of exposed assets can lock in dependence on further protection
    measures. Appropriate adaptation options can be better assessed by including co-benefits
    and mitigation implications.  Numerous interacting constraints can impede adaptation
    planning and implementation. Common constraints on implementation arise from the
    following: limited financial and human resources; limited integration or coordination
    of governance; uncertainties about projected impacts; different perceptions of
    risks; competing values; absence of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and
    limited tools to monitor adaptation effectiveness. Other constraints include insufficient
    research, monitoring and observation and the financial and other resources to
    maintain them. Underestimating the complexity of adaptation as a social process
    can create unrealistic expectations about achieving intended adaptation outcomes
    .  Greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding
    adaptation limits. Limits to adaptation occur when adaptive actions to avoid intolerable
    risks for an actor’s objectives or for the needs of a system are not possible
    or are not currently available. Value-based judgments of what constitutes an intolerable
    risk may differ. Limits to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate
    change and biophysical and/or socio-economic constraints. Opportunities to take
    advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease
    with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. In some parts of
    the world, insufficient responses to emerging impacts are already eroding the
    basis for sustainable development. For most regions and sectors, empirical evidence
    is not sufficient to quantify magnitudes of climate change that would constitute
    a future adaptation limit. Furthermore, economic development, technology and cultural
    norms and values can change over time to enhance or reduce the capacity of systems
    to avoid limits. As a consequence, some limits are ‘soft’ in that they may be
    alleviated over time. Other limits are ‘hard’ in that there are no reasonable
    prospects for avoiding intolerable risks.  Transformations in economic, social,
    technological and political decisions and actions can enhance adaptation and promote
    sustainable development. Restricting adaptation responses to incremental changes
    to existing systems and structures without considering transformational change
    may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities. For example, enhancing infrastructure
    to protect other built assets can be expensive and ultimately not defray increasing
    costs and risks, whereas options such as relocation or using ecosystem services
    to adapt may provide a range of benefits now and in the future. Transformational
    adaptation can include introduction of new technologies or practices, formation
    of new financial structures or systems of governance, adaptation at greater scales
    or magnitudes and shifts in the location of activities. Planning and implementation
    of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened, altered or aligned
    paradigms and consequently may place new and increased demands on governance structures
    to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address possible
    equity and ethical implications: transformational adaptation pathways are enhanced
    by iterative learning, deliberative processes, and innovation. At the national
    level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a country’s
    own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance
    with its national circumstances and priorities.  Building adaptive capacity is
    crucial for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options . Successful
    adaptation requires not only identifying adaptation options and assessing their
    costs and benefits, but also increasing the adaptive capacity of human and natural
    systems . This can involve complex governance challenges and new institutions
    and institutional arrangements.  Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs
    exist between mitigation and adaptation and among different adaptation responses;
    interactions occur both within and across regions . Increasing efforts to mitigate
    and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly
    at the intersections among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools
    to understand and manage these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions
    with co-benefits include improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources,
    leading to reduced emissions of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants;
    reduced energy and water consumption in urban areas through greening cities and
    recycling water; sustainable agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems
    for carbon storage and other ecosystem services.'
  3.4a:
  - Characteristics of mitigation pathways  There are multiple mitigation pathways
    that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
    These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few
    decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by
    the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological,
    economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional
    mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower
    or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. Without
    additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global
    emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and
    economic activities. Global GHG emissions under most scenarios without additional
    mitigation  are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 21003520which
    is approximately between the 2100 emission levels in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways
    3621 . Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration
    levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Global
    mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above
    the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C
    to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty 3722 . The future scenarios do not
    account for possible changes in natural forcings in the climate system.  Many
    different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be
    used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. To evaluate possible pathways
    to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for
    this assessment, each of which describes different technological, socio-economic
    and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations
    in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the
    2100 forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concentration levels
    of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed.  Scenarios leading to CO2-eq
    concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming
    below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more
    likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
    unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.
    In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
    unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by
    2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the
    century and subsequently declines.  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm
    CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve temporary overshootof atmospheric concentrations,
    as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100. Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely
    on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide
    capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability
    and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies and methods are
    uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated
    with challenges and risks 3924 . CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without
    overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is
    more expensive.  Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions
    by mid-century through largescale changes in energy systems and possibly land
    use. Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less
    quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.
    Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by
    a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions
    levels near zero or below in 2100. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are
    characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and
    vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
    more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling
    of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear
    energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the
    year 2050. The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
    different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation and
    reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentrations of 500 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative
    to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming
    to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely
    than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
    by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between
    70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of
    emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood
    to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1.  Reducing
    emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. Emissions of nonCO2 gases, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) contributed
    about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases,
    near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However,
    some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions
    from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of
    most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
    scenarios. The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2
    climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies.  All
    current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude
    of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain
    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation
    trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below
    2°C relative to pre-industrial levels , but they do not preclude the option to
    meet this goal . The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
    scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels.  Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation
    vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency
    of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation
    immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all
    key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for
    estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs. Under these assumptions, mitigation
    scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including
    benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of mitigation —of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative
    to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than
    900% over the century . These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of
    consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative
    to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per
    year. In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies
    , mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
    . Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation
    costs in the medium- to long-term. Many models could not limit likely warming
    to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional
    mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such
    as bioenergy, CCS and their combination are limited .  Mitigation efforts and
    associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs
    can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves. In globally cost-effective
    scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the
    highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular
    effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have
    estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
    that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st
    century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.

    economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional
    mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower
    or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. Without
    additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global
    emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and
    economic activities. Global GHG emissions under most scenarios without additional
    mitigation  are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 21003520which
    is approximately between the 2100 emission levels in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways
    3621 . Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration
    levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Global
    mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above
    the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C
    to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty 3722 . The future scenarios do not
    account for possible changes in natural forcings in the climate system.  Many
    different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be
    used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. To evaluate possible pathways
    to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for
    this assessment, each of which describes different technological, socio-economic
    and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations
    in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the
    2100 forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concentration levels
    of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed.  Scenarios leading to CO2-eq
    concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming
    below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more
    likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
    unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.
    In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
    unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by
    2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the
    century and subsequently declines.  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm
    CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve temporary overshootof atmospheric concentrations,
    as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100. Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely
    on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide
    capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability
    and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies and methods are
    uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated
    with challenges and risks 3924 . CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without
    overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is
    more expensive.  Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions
    by mid-century through largescale changes in energy systems and possibly land
    use. Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less
    quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.
    Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by
    a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions
    levels near zero or below in 2100. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are
    characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and
    vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
    more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling
    of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear
    energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the
    year 2050. The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
    different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation and
    reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentrations of 500 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative
    to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming
    to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely
    than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
    by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between
    70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of
    emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood
    to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1.  Reducing
    emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. Emissions of nonCO2 gases, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) contributed
    about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases,
    near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However,
    some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions
    from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of
    most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
    scenarios. The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2
    climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies.  All
    current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude
    of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain
    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation
    trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below
    2°C relative to pre-industrial levels , but they do not preclude the option to
    meet this goal . The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
    scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels.  Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation
    vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency
    of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation
    immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all
    key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for
    estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs. Under these assumptions, mitigation
    scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including
    benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of mitigation —of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative
    to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than
    900% over the century . These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of
    consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative
    to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per
    year. In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies
    , mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
    . Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation
    costs in the medium- to long-term. Many models could not limit likely warming
    to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional
    mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such
    as bioenergy, CCS and their combination are limited .  Mitigation efforts and
    associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs
    can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves. In globally cost-effective
    scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the
    highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular
    effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have
    estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
    that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st
    century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
  3.4d:
  - Characteristics of mitigation pathways  There are multiple mitigation pathways
    that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
    These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few
    decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by
    the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological,

    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation
    trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below
    2°C relative to pre-industrial levels , but they do not preclude the option to
    meet this goal . The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
    scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels.  Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation
    vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency
    of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation
    immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all
    key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for
    estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs. Under these assumptions, mitigation
    scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including
    benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of mitigation —of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative
    to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than
    900% over the century . These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of
    consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative
    to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per
    year. In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies
    , mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
    . Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation
    costs in the medium- to long-term. Many models could not limit likely warming
    to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional
    mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such
    as bioenergy, CCS and their combination are limited .  Mitigation efforts and
    associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs
    can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves. In globally cost-effective
    scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the
    highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular
    effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have
    estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
    that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st
    century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
  3.4f:
  - Characteristics of mitigation pathways  There are multiple mitigation pathways
    that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
    These pathways would require substantial emissions reductions over the next few
    decades and near zero emissions of CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases by
    the end of the century. Implementing such reductions poses substantial technological,
    economic, social and institutional challenges, which increase with delays in additional
    mitigation and if key technologies are not available. Limiting warming to lower
    or higher levels involves similar challenges but on different timescales. Without
    additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today, global
    emission growth is expected to persist driven by growth in global population and
    economic activities. Global GHG emissions under most scenarios without additional
    mitigation  are between about 75 GtCO2-eq/yr and almost 140 GtCO2-eq/yr in 21003520which
    is approximately between the 2100 emission levels in the RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 pathways
    3621 . Baseline scenarios exceed 450 ppm CO2-eq by 2030 and reach CO2-eq concentration
    levels between about 750 ppm CO2-eq and more than 1300 ppm CO2-eq by 2100. Global
    mean surface temperature increases in 2100 range from about 3.7°C to 4.8°C above
    the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from 2.5°C
    to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty 3722 . The future scenarios do not
    account for possible changes in natural forcings in the climate system.  Many
    different combinations of technological, behavioural and policy options can be
    used to reduce emissions and limit temperature change. To evaluate possible pathways
    to long-term climate goals, about 900 mitigation scenarios were collected for
    this assessment, each of which describes different technological, socio-economic
    and institutional changes. Emission reductions under these scenarios lead to concentrations
    in 2100 from 430 ppm CO2-eq to above 720 ppm CO2-eq which is comparable to the
    2100 forcing levels between RCP2.6 and RCP6.0. Scenarios with concentration levels
    of below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 were also assessed.  Scenarios leading to CO2-eq
    concentrations in 2100 of about 450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain warming
    below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios reaching concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more
    likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
    unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.
    In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
    unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by
    2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the
    century and subsequently declines.  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm
    CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve temporary overshootof atmospheric concentrations,
    as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100. Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely
    on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide
    capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability
    and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies and methods are
    uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated
    with challenges and risks 3924 . CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without
    overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is
    more expensive.  Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions
    by mid-century through largescale changes in energy systems and possibly land
    use. Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less
    quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.
    Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by
    a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions
    levels near zero or below in 2100. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are
    characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and
    vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
    more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling
    of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear
    energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the
    year 2050. The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
    different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation and
    reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentrations of 500 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative
    to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming
    to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely
    than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
    by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between
    70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of
    emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood
    to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1.  Reducing
    emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. Emissions of nonCO2 gases, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) contributed
    about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases,
    near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However,
    some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions
    from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of
    most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
    scenarios. The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2
    climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies.  All
    current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude
    of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain
    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based

    likely than not to limit warming to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels,
    unless concentration levels temporarily exceed roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100.
    In this case, warming is about as likely as not to remain below 2°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels. Scenarios that exceed about 650 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are
    unlikely to limit warming to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. Mitigation
    scenarios in which warming is more likely than not to be less than 1.5°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels by 2100 are characterized by concentration levels by
    2100 of below 430 ppm CO2-eq. In these scenarios, temperature peaks during the
    century and subsequently declines.  Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm
    CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve temporary overshootof atmospheric concentrations,
    as do many scenarios reaching about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100. Depending on the level of overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely
    on the availability and widespread deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide
    capture and storage and afforestation in the second half of the century. The availability
    and scale of these and other Carbon Dioxide Removal technologies and methods are
    uncertain, and CDR technologies and methods are, to varying degrees, associated
    with challenges and risks 3924 . CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios without
    overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is
    more expensive.  Limiting warming with a likely chance to less than 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels would require substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions
    by mid-century through largescale changes in energy systems and possibly land
    use. Limiting warming to higher levels would require similar changes but less
    quickly. Limiting warming to lower levels would require these changes more quickly.
    Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C are characterized by
    a 40 to 70% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and emissions
    levels near zero or below in 2100. Scenarios with higher emissions in 2050 are
    characterized by a greater reliance on CDR technologies beyond mid-century, and
    vice versa. Scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2°C include
    more rapid improvements in energy efficiency and a tripling to nearly a quadrupling
    of the share of zero- and low-carbon energy supply from renewable energy, nuclear
    energy and fossil energy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or BECCS by the
    year 2050. The scenarios describe a wide range of changes in land use, reflecting
    different assumptions about the scale of bioenergy production, afforestation and
    reduced deforestation. Scenarios leading to concentrations of 500 ppm CO2-eq by
    2100 are characterized by a 25 to 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, relative
    to 2010 levels. Scenarios that are likely to limit warming to 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly than those limiting warming
    to 2°C. Only a limited number of studies provide scenarios that are more likely
    than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios are characterized
    by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission reduction between
    70 and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of
    emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and their likelihood
    to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Table 3.1.  Reducing
    emissions of non-CO2 climate forcing agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. Emissions of nonCO2 gases, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases) contributed
    about 27% to the total emissions of Kyoto gases in 2010. For most non-CO2 gases,
    near-term, low-cost options are available to reduce their emissions. However,
    some sources of these non-CO2 gases are difficult to mitigate, such as N2O emissions
    from fertilizer use and CH4 emissions from livestock. As a result, emissions of
    most non-CO2 gases will not be reduced to zero, even under stringent mitigation
    scenarios. The differences in radiative properties and lifetimes of CO2 and non-CO2
    climate forcing agents have important implications for mitigation strategies.  All
    current GHG emissions and other climate forcing agents affect the rate and magnitude
    of climate change over the next few decades. Reducing the emissions of certain
    short-lived climate forcing agents can reduce the rate of warming in the short
    term but will have only a limited effect on long-term warming, which is driven
    mainly by CO2 emissions. There are large uncertainties related to the climate
    impacts of some of the short-lived climate forcing agents. Although the effects
    of CH4 emissions are well understood, there are large uncertainties related to
    the effects of black carbon. Co-emitted components with cooling effects may further
    complicate and reduce the climate impacts of emission reductions. Reducing emissions
    of sulfur dioxide would cause warming. Near-term reductions in short-lived climate
    forcing agents can have a relatively fast impact on climate change and possible
    co-benefits for air pollution.  Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially
    increase the challenges associated with limiting warming over the 21st century
    to below 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels. GHG emissions in 2030 lie between
    about 30 GtCO2-eq/yr and 50 GtCO2-eq/yr in cost-effective scenarios that are likely
    to about as likely as not to limit warming to less than 2°C this century relative
    to pre-industrial levels  . Scenarios with GHG emission levels of above 55 GtCO2-eq/yr
    require substantially higher rates of emissions reductions between 2030 and 2050
    ; much more rapid scale-up of zero and low-carbon energy over this period ; a
    larger reliance on CDR technologies in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts.  Estimated global emission levels by 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective long-term mitigation
    trajectories that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below
    2°C relative to pre-industrial levels , but they do not preclude the option to
    meet this goal . The Cancún Pledges are broadly consistent with cost-effective
    scenarios that are likely to limit temperature change to below 3°C relative to
    pre-industrial levels.  Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation
    vary widely depending on methodologies and assumptions but increase with the stringency
    of mitigation. Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation
    immediately, in which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all
    key technologies are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for
    estimating macroeconomic mitigation costs. Under these assumptions, mitigation
    scenarios that are likely to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels entail losses in global consumption—not including
    benefits of reduced climate change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of mitigation —of 1 to 4% in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100, relative
    to consumption in baseline scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than
    900% over the century . These numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of
    consumption growth by 0.04 to 0.14 percentage points over the century relative
    to annualized consumption growth in the baseline that is between 1.6% and 3% per
    year. In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies
    , mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered
    . Delaying additional mitigation reduces near-term costs but increases mitigation
    costs in the medium- to long-term. Many models could not limit likely warming
    to below 2°C over the 21st century relative to pre-industrial levels, if additional
    mitigation is considerably delayed, or if availability of key technologies, such
    as bioenergy, CCS and their combination are limited .  Mitigation efforts and
    associated cost are expected to vary across countries. The distribution of costs
    can differ from the distribution of the actions themselves. In globally cost-effective
    scenarios, the majority of mitigation efforts takes place in countries with the
    highest future GHG emissions in baseline scenarios. Some studies exploring particular
    effort-sharing frameworks, under the assumption of a global carbon market, have
    estimated substantial global financial flows associated with mitigation in scenarios
    that are likely to more unlikely than likely to limit warming during the 21st
    century to less than 2°C relative to pre-industrial levels.
  3.4i:
  - 'Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational
    mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions
    were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However,
    there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past
    trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and
    implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate
    impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus
    on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and
    reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits
    in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been
    more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests
    that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific
    policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies
    harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be
    better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors
    and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms
    that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can
    achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse
    effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run
    environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of
    loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries,
    tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology
    and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross
    domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have
    had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes
    or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes
    and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general
    principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have
    lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the
    form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy
    designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An
    increasing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by
    many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years.
    Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies.
    Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers
    in most developing countries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns
    have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is broadening
    from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling
    and transportation.  The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in
    various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic
    context. While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent
    literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing
    literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of
    subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global
    aggregate emissions by mid-century . Studies vary in methodology, the type and
    definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out considered. In particular,
    the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides
    without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, keeping
    in mind national circumstances.  Regulatory approaches and information measures
    are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory
    approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes
    include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions.  Mitigation
    policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters,
    but differences between regions and fuels exist. Most mitigation scenarios are
    associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters.
    The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability
    of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel
    assets.  Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic
    or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions . For instance, a carbon
    tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for
    the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent
    cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further
    impact on reducing emissions  . In either case, additional policies may be needed
    to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.  Sub-national
    climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies
    and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans
    combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade
    systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national
    actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset
    markets, and networks of cities seeking to collaborate in generating low-carbon
    urban development.  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect
    achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security,
    biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable
    sustainable development:  • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm
    CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy
    security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem
    impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system.  • Some
    mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper
    the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved
    populations . These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with the adoption
    of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer
    mechanisms. The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and
    clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72 to 95 billion
    per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emissions and multiple benefits
    in health and air pollutant reduction.  Whether or not side effects materialize,
    and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific,
    and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation.
    Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified.'

  - Common enabling factors and constraints  for adaptation and mitigation responses
    Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors.
    These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments
    in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods
    and behavioural and lifestyle choices. Innovation and investments in environmentally
    sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
    enhance resilience to climate change . Innovation and change can expand the availability
    and/ or effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. For example, investments
    in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies can reduce the energy intensity
    of economic development, the carbon intensity of energy, GHG emissions, and the
    long-term costs of mitigation. Similarly, new technologies and infrastructure
    can increase the resilience of human systems while reducing adverse impacts on
    natural systems. Investments in technology and infrastructure rely on an enabling
    policy environment, access to finance and technology and broader economic development
    that builds capacity .  Adaptation and mitigation are constrained by the inertia
    of global and regional trends in economic development, GHG emissions, resource
    consumption, infrastructure and settlement patterns, institutional behaviour and
    technology . Such inertia may limit the capacity to reduce GHG emissions, remain
    below particular climate thresholds or avoid adverse impacts. Some constraints
    may be overcome through new technologies, financial resources, increased institutional
    effectiveness and governance or changes in social and cultural attitudes and behaviours.  Vulnerability
    to climate change, GHG emissions, and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation
    are strongly influenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture  . Shifts
    toward more energy-intensive lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource
    consumption, driving greater energy production and GHG emissions and increasing
    mitigation costs. In contrast, emissions can be substantially lowered through
    changes in consumption patterns. The social acceptability and/or effectiveness
    of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or
    depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. Similarly,
    livelihoods that depend on climate-sensitive sectors or resources may be particularly
    vulnerable to climate change and climate change policies. Economic development
    and urbanization of landscapes exposed to climate hazards may increase the exposure
    of human settlements and reduce the resilience of natural systems.  For many regions
    and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation
    essential for managing climate change risks. Such capacities are place- and context-specific
    and therefore there is no single approach for reducing risk that is appropriate
    across all settings. For example, developing nations with low income levels have
    the lowest financial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon,
    climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed nations generally have
    greater relative capacity to manage the risks of climate change, such capacity
    does not necessarily translate into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation
    options.  Improving institutions as well as enhancing coordination and cooperation
    in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation,
    adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Despite the presence of a wide array of
    multilateral, national and sub-national institutions focused on adaptation and
    mitigation, global GHG emissions continue to increase and identified adaptation
    needs have not been adequately addressed. The implementation of effective adaptation
    and mitigation options may necessitate new institutions and institutional arrangements

    essential for managing climate change risks. Such capacities are place- and context-specific
    and therefore there is no single approach for reducing risk that is appropriate
    across all settings. For example, developing nations with low income levels have
    the lowest financial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon,
    climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed nations generally have
    greater relative capacity to manage the risks of climate change, such capacity
    does not necessarily translate into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation
    options.  Improving institutions as well as enhancing coordination and cooperation
    in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation,
    adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Despite the presence of a wide array of
    multilateral, national and sub-national institutions focused on adaptation and
    mitigation, global GHG emissions continue to increase and identified adaptation
    needs have not been adequately addressed. The implementation of effective adaptation
    and mitigation options may necessitate new institutions and institutional arrangements
    that span multiple scales  .
  4.2a:
  - 'Response options for adaptation  Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but
    their context for implementation and potential to reduce climate-related risks
    differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve significant
    co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase
    challenges for many adaptation options. People, governments and the private sector
    are starting to adapt to a changing climate. Since the IPCC Fourth Assessment
    Report , understanding of response options has increased, with improved knowledge
    of their benefits, costs and links to sustainable development. Adaptation can
    take a variety of approaches depending on its context in vulnerability reduction,
    disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning. These include : • Social,
    ecological asset and infrastructure development • Technological process optimization
    • Integrated natural resources management • Institutional, educational and behavioural
    change or reinforcement • Financial services, including risk transfer • Information
    systems to support early warning and proactive planning There is increasing recognition
    of the value of social , institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the
    extent of constraints to adaptation. Effective strategies and actions consider
    the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and
    development plans.  Opportunities to enable adaptation planning and implementation
    exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending
    on context. The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected
    to increase with climate change . Examples of key adaptation approaches for particular
    sectors, including constraints and limits, are summarized below.  Freshwater resources
    Adaptive water management techniques, including scenario planning, learning-based
    approaches and flexible and low-regret solutions, can help adjust to uncertain
    hydrological changes due to climate change and their impacts . Strategies include
    adopting integrated water management, augmenting supply, reducing the mismatch
    between water supply and demand, reducing non-climate stressors, strengthening
    institutional capacities and adopting more water-efficient technologies and water-saving
    strategies.  Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems Management actions can reduce
    but not eliminate risks of impacts to terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems due
    to climate change. Actions include maintenance of genetic diversity, assisted
    species migration and dispersal, manipulation of disturbance regimes and reduction
    of other stressors. Management options that reduce non-climatic stressors, such
    as habitat modification, overexploitation, pollution and invasive species, increase
    the inherent capacity of ecosystems and their species to adapt to a changing climate.
    Other options include improving early warning systems and associated response
    systems. Enhanced connectivity of vulnerable ecosystems may also assist autonomous
    adaptation. Translocation of species is controversial and is expected to become
    less feasible where whole ecosystems are at risk.  Coastal systems and low-lying
    areas Increasingly, coastal adaptation options include those based on integrated
    coastal zone management, local community participation, ecosystems-based approaches
    and disaster risk reduction, mainstreamed into relevant strategies and management
    plans. The analysis and implementation of coastal adaptation has progressed more
    significantly in developed countries than in developing countries. The relative
    costs of coastal adaptation are expected to vary strongly among and within regions
    and countries.  Marine systems and oceans Marine forecasting and early warning
    systems as well as reducing non-climatic stressors have the potential to reduce
    risks for some fisheries and aquaculture industries, but options for unique ecosystems
    such as coral reefs are limited. Fisheries and some aquaculture industries with
    high-technology and/or large investments have high capacities for adaptation due
    to greater development of environmental monitoring, modelling and resource assessments.
    Adaptation options include large-scale translocation of industrial fishing activities
    and flexible management that can react to variability and change. For smaller-scale
    fisheries and nations with limited adaptive capacities, building social resilience,
    alternative livelihoods and occupational flexibility are important strategies.
    Adaptation options for coral reef systems are generally limited to reducing other
    stressors, mainly by enhancing water quality and limiting pressures from tourism
    and fishing, but their efficacy will be severely reduced as thermal stress and
    ocean acidification increase.  Food production system/Rural areas Adaptation options
    for agriculture include technological responses, enhancing smallholder access
    to credit and other critical production resources, strengthening institutions
    at local to regional levels and improving market access through trade reform.
    Responses to decreased food production and quality include: developing new crop
    varieties adapted to changes in CO2, temperature, and drought; enhancing the capacity
    for climate risk management; and offsetting economic impacts of land use change.
    Improving financial support and investing in the production of small-scale farms
    can also provide benefits. Expanding agricultural markets and improving the predictability
    and reliability of the world trading system could result in reduced market volatility
    and help manage food supply shortages caused by climate change.  Urban areas/Key
    economic sectors and services Urban adaptation benefits from effective multi-level
    governance, alignment of policies and incentives, strengthened local government
    and community adaptation capacity, synergies with the private sector and appropriate
    financing and institutional development. Enhancing the capacity of low-income
    groups and vulnerable communities and their partnerships with local governments
    can also be an effective urban climate adaptation strategy. Examples of adaptation
    mechanisms include large-scale public-private risk reduction initiatives and economic
    diversification and government insurance for the non-diversifiable portion of
    risk. In some locations, especially at the upper end of projected climate changes,
    responses could also require transformational changes such as managed retreat.  Human
    health, security and livelihoods Adaptation options that focus on strengthening
    existing delivery systems and institutions, as well as insurance and social protection
    strategies, can improve health, security and livelihoods in the near term. The
    most effective vulnerability reduction measures for health in the near term are
    programmes that implement and improve basic public health measures such as provision
    of clean water and sanitation, secure essential health care including vaccination
    and child health services, increase capacity for disaster preparedness and response
    and alleviate poverty. Options to address heat related mortality include health
    warning systems linked to response strategies, urban planning and improvements
    to the built environment to reduce heat stress. Robust institutions can manage
    many transboundary impacts of climate change to reduce risk of conflicts over
    shared natural resources. Insurance programmes, social protection measures and
    disaster risk management may enhance long-term livelihood resilience among the
    poor and marginalized people, if policies address multi-dimensional poverty.  Significant
    co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between adaptation and mitigation
    and among different adaptation responses; interactions occur both within and across
    regions and sectors. For example, investments in crop varieties adapted to climate
    change can increase the capacity to cope with drought, and public health measures
    to address vector-borne diseases can enhance the capacity of health systems to
    address other challenges. Similarly, locating infrastructure away from low-lying
    coastal areas helps settlements and ecosystems adapt to sea level rise while also
    protecting against tsunamis. However, some adaptation options may have adverse
    side effects that imply real or perceived trade-offs with other adaptation objectives,
    mitigation objectives or broader development goals. For example, while protection
    of ecosystems can assist adaptation to climate change and enhance carbon storage,
    increased use of air conditioning to maintain thermal comfort in buildings or
    the use of desalination to enhance water resource security can increase energy
    demand, and therefore, GHG emissions.'
  4.2b:
  - 'Human responses to climate change:  adaptation and mitigation Adaptation and
    mitigation experience is accumulating across regions and scales, even while global
    anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase. Throughout
    history, people and societies have adjusted to and coped with climate, climate
    variability and extremes, with varying degrees of success. In today’s changing
    climate, accumulating experience with adaptation and mitigation efforts can provide
    opportunities for learning and refinement.  Adaptation is becoming embedded in
    some planning processes, with more limited implementation of responses . Engineered
    and technological options are commonly implemented adaptive responses, often integrated
    within existing programmes, such as disaster risk management and water management.
    There is increasing recognition of the value of social, institutional and ecosystem-based
    measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation.  Governments at various
    levels have begun to develop adaptation plans and policies and integrate climate
    change considerations into broader development plans. Examples of adaptation are
    now available from all regions of the world .  Global increases in anthropogenic
    emissions and climate impacts have occurred, even while mitigation activities
    have taken place in many parts of the world. Though various mitigation initiatives
    between the sub-national and global scales have been developed or implemented,

  - 'Adaptation  Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public
    and private sector and within communities . Adaptation options adopted to date
    emphasize incremental adjustments and co-benefits and are starting to emphasize
    flexibility and learning. Most assessments of adaptation have been restricted
    to impacts, vulnerability and adaptation planning, with very few assessing the
    processes of implementation or the effects of adaptation actions .  National governments
    play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation. There has been substantial
    progress since the AR4 in the development of national adaptation strategies and
    plans. This includes National Adaptation Programmes of Action by least developed
    countries, the National Adaptation Plan process, and strategic frameworks for
    national adaptation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
    countries. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and
    sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting
    economic diversification, and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks
    and financial support.  While local government and the private sector have different
    functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recognized as critical
    to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities,
    households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing .
    There is a significant increase in the number of planned adaptation responses
    at the local level in rural and urban communities of developed and developing
    countries since the AR4. However, local councils and planners are often confronted
    by the complexity of adaptation without adequate access to guiding information
    or data on local vulnerabilities and potential impacts. Steps for mainstreaming
    adaptation into local decision-making have been identified but challenges remain
    in their implementation. Hence, scholars stress the important role of linkages
    with national and sub-national levels of government as well as partnerships among
    public, civic and private sectors in implementing local adaptation responses.  Institutional
    dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into
    planning and decision-making, play a key role in promoting the transition from
    planning to implementation of adaptation . The most commonly emphasized institutional
    barriers or enablers for adaptation planning and implementation are: 1) multilevel
    institutional co-ordination between different political and administrative levels
    in society; 2) key actors, advocates and champions initiating, mainstreaming and
    sustaining momentum for climate adaptation; 3) horizontal interplay between sectors,
    actors and policies operating at similar administrative levels; 4) political dimensions
    in planning and implementation; and 5) coordination between formal governmental,
    administrative agencies and private sectors and stakeholders to increase efficiency,
    representation and support for climate adaptation measures.  Existing and emerging
    economic instruments can foster adaptation by providing incentives for anticipating
    and reducing impacts. Instruments include public-private finance partnerships,
    loans, payments for environmental services, improved resource pricing, charges
    and subsidies, norms and regulations and risk sharing and transfer mechanisms.
    Risk financing mechanisms in the public and private sector, such as insurance
    and risk pools, can contribute to increasing resilience, but without attention
    to major design challenges, they can also provide disincentives, cause market
    failure and decrease equity. Governments often play key roles as regulators, providers
    or insurers of last resort.'

  4.3a:
  - Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major
    sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach
    that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of
    end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon
    sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available
    that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements
    of technology, behaviour, production and resource efficiency and enable structural
    changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry
    and other land use involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest
    degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing
    bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors
    but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and industry. An overview of sectoral
    mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4.  Well-designed systemic
    and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions
    than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector
    affecting the need for mitigation in others . In baseline scenarios without new
    mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except
    for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector. Mitigation scenarios reaching around
    450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 21004328 show largescale global changes in the
    energy supply sector . While rapid decarbonization of energy supply generally
    entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions
    lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system. There
    are thus strong interdependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution
    of the mitigation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance
    of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation . The
    next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas,
    as a large portion of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period.  Decarbonizing
    electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies
    in achieving low stabilization levels  . In most integrated modelling scenarios,
    decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry,
    buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations
    by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline
    over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below
    2010 levels between 2040 and 2070.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes,
    in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising
    development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq
    concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 . Near-term reductions in
    energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies,
    provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector,
    hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures
    and are associated with important co-benefits . Emissions can be substantially
    lowered through changes in consumption patterns  and dietary change and reduction
    in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives
    as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes.  Decarbonization
    of the energy supply sector  requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity
    generation technologies. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios
    , the share of low-carbon electricity supply, nuclear and CCS, including BECCS)
    increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050
    and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost
    entirely by 2100. Among these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE
    technologies have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at significant
    scale since AR4 and nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload
    power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining. GHG
    emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current
    world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas
    combined-cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural
    gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply
    are low or mitigated.  Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence
    on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some
    sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change
    . In the transport sector, technical and behavioural mitigation measures for all
    modes, plus new infrastructure and urban redevelopment investments, could reduce
    final energy demand significantly below baseline levels. While opportunities for
    switching to low-carbon fuels exist, the rate of decarbonization in the transport
    sector might be constrained by challenges associated with energy storage and the
    relatively low energy density of low-carbon transport fuels. In the building sector,
    recent advances in technologies, know-how and policies provide opportunities to
    stabilize or reduce global energy use to about current levels by mid-century.
    In addition, recent improvements in performance and costs make very low energy
    construction and retrofits of buildings economically attractive, sometimes even
    at net negative costs. In the industry sector, improvements in GHG emission efficiency
    and in the efficiency of material use, recycling and reuse of materials and products,
    and overall reductions in product demand  and service demand could, in addition
    to energy efficiency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. Prevalent
    approaches for promoting energy efficiency in industry include information programmes
    followed by economic instruments, regulatory approaches and voluntary actions.
    Important options for mitigation in waste management are waste reduction, followed
    by re-use, recycling and energy recovery.  The most cost-effective mitigation
    options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing
    deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions.
    In agriculture, the most cost-effective mitigation options are cropland management,
    grazing land management and restoration of organic soils . About a third of mitigation
    potential in forestry can be achieved at a cost <20 USD/tCO2-eq emission. Demand-side
    measures, such as changes in diet and reductions of losses in the food supply
    chain, have a significant, but uncertain, potential to reduce GHG emissions from
    food production .  Bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but there
    are issues to consider, such as the sustainability of practices and the efficiency
    of bioenergy systems . Evidence suggests that bioenergy options with low lifecycle
    emissions, some already available, can reduce GHG emissions; outcomes are site-specific
    and rely on efficient integrated ‘biomassto-bioenergy systems’, and sustainable
    land use management and governance. Barriers to large-scale deployment of bioenergy
    include concerns about GHG emissions from land, food security, water resources,
    biodiversity conservation and livelihoods.  Mitigation measures intersect with
    other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects.
    These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking
    climate mitigation actions . Mitigation can positively or negatively influence
    the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health,
    food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods
    and equitable sustainable development . On the other hand, policies towards other
    societal goals can influence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives.
    These influences can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify,
    especially in welfare terms. This multi-objective perspective is important in
    part because it helps to identify areas where support for policies that advance
    multiple goals will be robust. Potential co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of the main sectoral mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.5. Overall,
    the potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweigh the potential
    for adverse side effects, whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case
    for all energy supply and AFOLU measures.
  4.3b:
  - Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major
    sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach
    that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of
    end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon
    sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available
    that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements
    of technology, behaviour, production and resource efficiency and enable structural
    changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry
    and other land use involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest
    degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing
    bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors
    but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and industry. An overview of sectoral
    mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4.  Well-designed systemic
    and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions
    than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector
    affecting the need for mitigation in others . In baseline scenarios without new
    mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except
    for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector. Mitigation scenarios reaching around
    450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 21004328 show largescale global changes in the
    energy supply sector . While rapid decarbonization of energy supply generally
    entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions
    lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system. There
    are thus strong interdependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution
    of the mitigation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance
    of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation . The
    next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas,
    as a large portion of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period.  Decarbonizing
    electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies
    in achieving low stabilization levels  . In most integrated modelling scenarios,
    decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry,
    buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations
    by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline
    over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below
    2010 levels between 2040 and 2070.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes,
    in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising
    development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq
    concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 . Near-term reductions in
    energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies,
    provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector,
    hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures
    and are associated with important co-benefits . Emissions can be substantially
    lowered through changes in consumption patterns  and dietary change and reduction
    in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives
    as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes.  Decarbonization
    of the energy supply sector  requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity
    generation technologies. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios
    , the share of low-carbon electricity supply, nuclear and CCS, including BECCS)
    increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050
    and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost
    entirely by 2100. Among these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE

    for all energy supply and AFOLU measures.
  4.3d:
  - Common enabling factors and constraints  for adaptation and mitigation responses
    Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors.
    These include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments
    in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods
    and behavioural and lifestyle choices. Innovation and investments in environmentally
    sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and
    enhance resilience to climate change . Innovation and change can expand the availability
    and/ or effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. For example, investments
    in low-carbon and carbon-neutral energy technologies can reduce the energy intensity
    of economic development, the carbon intensity of energy, GHG emissions, and the
    long-term costs of mitigation. Similarly, new technologies and infrastructure
    can increase the resilience of human systems while reducing adverse impacts on
    natural systems. Investments in technology and infrastructure rely on an enabling
    policy environment, access to finance and technology and broader economic development
    that builds capacity .  Adaptation and mitigation are constrained by the inertia
    of global and regional trends in economic development, GHG emissions, resource
    consumption, infrastructure and settlement patterns, institutional behaviour and
    technology . Such inertia may limit the capacity to reduce GHG emissions, remain
    below particular climate thresholds or avoid adverse impacts. Some constraints
    may be overcome through new technologies, financial resources, increased institutional
    effectiveness and governance or changes in social and cultural attitudes and behaviours.  Vulnerability
    to climate change, GHG emissions, and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation
    are strongly influenced by livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture  . Shifts
    toward more energy-intensive lifestyles can contribute to higher energy and resource
    consumption, driving greater energy production and GHG emissions and increasing
    mitigation costs. In contrast, emissions can be substantially lowered through
    changes in consumption patterns. The social acceptability and/or effectiveness
    of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or
    depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours. Similarly,
    livelihoods that depend on climate-sensitive sectors or resources may be particularly
    vulnerable to climate change and climate change policies. Economic development
    and urbanization of landscapes exposed to climate hazards may increase the exposure
    of human settlements and reduce the resilience of natural systems.  For many regions
    and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation
    essential for managing climate change risks. Such capacities are place- and context-specific
    and therefore there is no single approach for reducing risk that is appropriate
    across all settings. For example, developing nations with low income levels have
    the lowest financial, technological and institutional capacities to pursue low-carbon,
    climate-resilient development pathways. Although developed nations generally have
    greater relative capacity to manage the risks of climate change, such capacity
    does not necessarily translate into the implementation of adaptation and mitigation
    options.  Improving institutions as well as enhancing coordination and cooperation
    in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation,
    adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Despite the presence of a wide array of
    multilateral, national and sub-national institutions focused on adaptation and
    mitigation, global GHG emissions continue to increase and identified adaptation
    needs have not been adequately addressed. The implementation of effective adaptation
    and mitigation options may necessitate new institutions and institutional arrangements
    that span multiple scales  .
  - Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major

  4.4b:
  - 'International and regional cooperation  on adaptation and mitigation Because
    climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global
    scale, effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance
    their own interests independently, even though mitigation can also have local
    co-benefits. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are therefore
    required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate change
    issues. While adaptation focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes,
    its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordination across governance scales,
    including international cooperation. In fact, international cooperation has helped
    to facilitate the creation of adaptation strategies, plans, and actions at national,
    sub-national, and local levels. A variety of climate policy instruments have been
    employed, and even more could be employed, at international and regional levels
    to address mitigation and to support and promote adaptation at national and sub-national
    scales. Evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective
    cooperation.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the
    main multilateral forum focused on addressing climate change, with nearly universal
    participation. UNFCCC activities since 2007, which include the 2010 Cancún Agreements
    and the 2011 Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, have sought to enhance actions
    under the Convention, and have led to an increasing number of institutions and
    other arrangements for international climate change cooperation. Other institutions
    organized at different levels of governance have resulted in diversifying international
    climate change cooperation.  Existing and proposed international climate change
    cooperation arrangements vary in their focus and degree of centralization and
    coordination. They span: multilateral agreements, harmonized national policies
    and decentralized but coordinated national policies, as well as regional and regionally-coordinated
    policies .  While a number of new institutions are focused on adaptation funding
    and coordination, adaptation has historically received less attention than mitigation
    in international climate policy . Inclusion of adaptation is increasingly important
    to reduce the risk from climate change impacts and may engage a greater number
    of countries.  The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate
    objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to participation, implementation,
    flexibility mechanisms, and environmental effectiveness. The Protocol was the
    first binding step toward implementing the principles and goals provided by the
    UNFCCC. According to national GHG inventories through 2012 submitted to the UNFCCC
    by October 2013, Annex B Parties with quantified emission limitations  in aggregate
    may have bettered their collective emission reduction target in the first commitment
    period, but some emissions reductions that would have occurred even in its absence
    were also counted. The Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism created a market
    for emissions offsets from developing countries, the purpose being two-fold: to
    help Annex I countries fulfill their commitments and to assist non-Annex I countries
    achieve sustainable development. The CDM generated Certified Emission Reductions
    equivalent to emissions of over 1.4 GtCO2-eqby October 2013, led to significant
    project investments, and generated investment flows for a variety of functions,
    including the UNFCCC Adaptation Fund. However, its environmental effectiveness
    has been questioned by some, particularly in regard to its early years, due to
    concerns about the additionality of projects , the validity of baselines, and
    the possibility of emissions leakage . Such concerns about additionality are common
    to any emission-reduction-credit program, and are not specific to the CDM. Due
    to market forces, the majority of single CDM projects have been concentrated in
    a limited number of countries, while Programmes of Activities, though less frequent,
    have been more evenly distributed. In addition, the Kyoto Protocol created two
    other ‘flexibility mechanisms’: Joint Implementation and International Emissions
    Trading.  Several conceptual models for effort-sharing have been identified in
    research. However, realized distributional impacts from actual international cooperative
    agreements depend not only on the approach taken but also on criteria applied
    to operationalize equity and the manner in which developing countries’ emissions
    reduction plans are financed.  Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national
    climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation benefits. Linkages
    have been established between carbon markets and in principle could also be established
    between and among a heterogeneous set of policy instruments including non-market-based
    policies, such as performance standards. Potential advantages include lower mitigation
    costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity.  Regional initiatives
    between national and global scales are being developed and implemented, but their
    impact on global mitigation has been limited to date. Some climate policies could
    be more environmentally and economically effective if implemented across broad
    regions, such as by embodying mitigation objectives in trade agreements or jointly
    constructing infrastructures that facilitate reduction in carbon emissions.  International
    cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has assisted
    in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at national, sub-national
    and local levels. For example, a range of multilateral and regionally targeted
    funding mechanisms have been established for adaptation; UN agencies, international
    development organizations and non-governmental organisations have provided information,
    methodologies and guidelines; and global and regional initiatives supported and
    promoted the creation of national adaptation strategies in both developing and
    developed countries. Closer integration of disaster risk reduction and climate
    change adaptation at the international level, and the mainstreaming of both into
    international development assistance, may foster greater efficiency in the use
    of resources and capacity. However, stronger efforts at the international level
    do not necessarily lead to substantive and rapid results at the local level.'
  4.4g:
  - 'Adaptation  Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public
    and private sector and within communities . Adaptation options adopted to date
    emphasize incremental adjustments and co-benefits and are starting to emphasize
    flexibility and learning. Most assessments of adaptation have been restricted
    to impacts, vulnerability and adaptation planning, with very few assessing the
    processes of implementation or the effects of adaptation actions .  National governments
    play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation. There has been substantial
    progress since the AR4 in the development of national adaptation strategies and
    plans. This includes National Adaptation Programmes of Action by least developed
    countries, the National Adaptation Plan process, and strategic frameworks for
    national adaptation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
    countries. National governments can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and
    sub-national governments, for example by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting
    economic diversification, and by providing information, policy and legal frameworks
    and financial support.  While local government and the private sector have different
    functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recognized as critical
    to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities,
    households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing .
    There is a significant increase in the number of planned adaptation responses
    at the local level in rural and urban communities of developed and developing
    countries since the AR4. However, local councils and planners are often confronted
    by the complexity of adaptation without adequate access to guiding information
    or data on local vulnerabilities and potential impacts. Steps for mainstreaming
    adaptation into local decision-making have been identified but challenges remain
    in their implementation. Hence, scholars stress the important role of linkages
    with national and sub-national levels of government as well as partnerships among
    public, civic and private sectors in implementing local adaptation responses.  Institutional
    dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into
    planning and decision-making, play a key role in promoting the transition from
    planning to implementation of adaptation . The most commonly emphasized institutional
    barriers or enablers for adaptation planning and implementation are: 1) multilevel
    institutional co-ordination between different political and administrative levels
    in society; 2) key actors, advocates and champions initiating, mainstreaming and
    sustaining momentum for climate adaptation; 3) horizontal interplay between sectors,
    actors and policies operating at similar administrative levels; 4) political dimensions
    in planning and implementation; and 5) coordination between formal governmental,
    administrative agencies and private sectors and stakeholders to increase efficiency,
    representation and support for climate adaptation measures.  Existing and emerging
    economic instruments can foster adaptation by providing incentives for anticipating
    and reducing impacts. Instruments include public-private finance partnerships,
    loans, payments for environmental services, improved resource pricing, charges
    and subsidies, norms and regulations and risk sharing and transfer mechanisms.
    Risk financing mechanisms in the public and private sector, such as insurance
    and risk pools, can contribute to increasing resilience, but without attention
    to major design challenges, they can also provide disincentives, cause market
    failure and decrease equity. Governments often play key roles as regulators, providers
    or insurers of last resort.'
  - 'Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational
    mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions
    were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However,
    there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past
    trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and
    implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate
    impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus
    on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and
    reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits
    in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been
    more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests
    that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific
    policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies
    harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be
    better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors
    and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms
    that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can
    achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse
    effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run
    environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of
    loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries,
    tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology
    and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross
    domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have
    had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes
    or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes
    and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general
    principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have
    lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the
    form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy
    designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An
    increasing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by
    many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years.
    Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies.
    Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers
    in most developing countries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns
    have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is broadening
    from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling
    and transportation.  The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in
    various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic
    context. While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent
    literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing
    literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of
    subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global
    aggregate emissions by mid-century . Studies vary in methodology, the type and
    definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out considered. In particular,
    the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides
    without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, keeping
    in mind national circumstances.  Regulatory approaches and information measures
    are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory
    approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes
    include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions.  Mitigation
    policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters,
    but differences between regions and fuels exist. Most mitigation scenarios are
    associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters.
    The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability
    of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel
    assets.  Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic
    or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions . For instance, a carbon
    tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for
    the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent
    cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further
    impact on reducing emissions  . In either case, additional policies may be needed
    to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.  Sub-national
    climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies
    and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans
    combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade
    systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national
    actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset
    markets, and networks of cities seeking to collaborate in generating low-carbon
    urban development.  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect
    achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security,
    biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable
    sustainable development:  • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm
    CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy
    security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem
    impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system.  • Some
    mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper
    the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved
    populations . These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with the adoption
    of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer
    mechanisms. The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and
    clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72 to 95 billion
    per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emissions and multiple benefits
    in health and air pollutant reduction.  Whether or not side effects materialize,
    and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific,
    and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation.

  4.4p:
  - Response options for mitigation  Mitigation options are available in every major
    sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective if using an integrated approach
    that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of
    end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon
    sinks in land-based sectors. A broad range of sectoral mitigation options is available
    that can reduce GHG emission intensity, improve energy intensity through enhancements
    of technology, behaviour, production and resource efficiency and enable structural
    changes or changes in activity. In addition, direct options in agriculture, forestry
    and other land use involve reducing CO2 emissions by reducing deforestation, forest
    degradation and forest fires; storing carbon in terrestrial systems; and providing
    bioenergy feedstocks. Options to reduce non-CO2 emissions exist across all sectors
    but most notably in agriculture, energy supply and industry. An overview of sectoral
    mitigation options and potentials is provided in Table 4.4.  Well-designed systemic
    and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions
    than a focus on individual technologies and sectors with efforts in one sector
    affecting the need for mitigation in others . In baseline scenarios without new
    mitigation policies, GHG emissions are projected to grow in all sectors, except
    for net CO2 emissions in the AFOLU sector. Mitigation scenarios reaching around
    450 ppm CO2-eq concentration by 21004328 show largescale global changes in the
    energy supply sector . While rapid decarbonization of energy supply generally
    entails more flexibility for end-use and AFOLU sectors, stronger demand reductions
    lessen the mitigation challenge for the supply side of the energy system. There
    are thus strong interdependencies across sectors and the resulting distribution
    of the mitigation effort is strongly influenced by the availability and performance
    of future technologies, particularly BECCS and large scale afforestation . The
    next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas,
    as a large portion of the world’s urban areas will be developed during this period.  Decarbonizing
    electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies
    in achieving low stabilization levels  . In most integrated modelling scenarios,
    decarbonization happens more rapidly in electricity generation than in the industry,
    buildings and transport sectors. In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations
    by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline
    over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below
    2010 levels between 2040 and 2070.  Efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes,
    in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising
    development, are a key mitigation strategy in scenarios reaching atmospheric CO2-eq
    concentrations of about 450 to about 500 ppm by 2100 . Near-term reductions in
    energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies,
    provide more flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector,
    hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures
    and are associated with important co-benefits . Emissions can be substantially
    lowered through changes in consumption patterns  and dietary change and reduction
    in food wastes. A number of options including monetary and non-monetary incentives
    as well as information measures may facilitate behavioural changes.  Decarbonization
    of the energy supply sector  requires upscaling of low- and zero-carbon electricity
    generation technologies. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios
    , the share of low-carbon electricity supply, nuclear and CCS, including BECCS)
    increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050
    and 90% by 2100, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost
    entirely by 2100. Among these low-carbon technologies, a growing number of RE
    technologies have achieved a level of maturity to enable deployment at significant
    scale since AR4 and nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload
    power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining. GHG
    emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current
    world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas
    combined-cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural
    gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply
    are low or mitigated.  Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence
    on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation potential in some
    sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change
    . In the transport sector, technical and behavioural mitigation measures for all
    modes, plus new infrastructure and urban redevelopment investments, could reduce
    final energy demand significantly below baseline levels. While opportunities for
    switching to low-carbon fuels exist, the rate of decarbonization in the transport
    sector might be constrained by challenges associated with energy storage and the
    relatively low energy density of low-carbon transport fuels. In the building sector,
    recent advances in technologies, know-how and policies provide opportunities to
    stabilize or reduce global energy use to about current levels by mid-century.
    In addition, recent improvements in performance and costs make very low energy
    construction and retrofits of buildings economically attractive, sometimes even
    at net negative costs. In the industry sector, improvements in GHG emission efficiency
    and in the efficiency of material use, recycling and reuse of materials and products,
    and overall reductions in product demand  and service demand could, in addition
    to energy efficiency, help reduce GHG emissions below the baseline level. Prevalent
    approaches for promoting energy efficiency in industry include information programmes
    followed by economic instruments, regulatory approaches and voluntary actions.
    Important options for mitigation in waste management are waste reduction, followed
    by re-use, recycling and energy recovery.  The most cost-effective mitigation
    options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing
    deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions.
    In agriculture, the most cost-effective mitigation options are cropland management,
    grazing land management and restoration of organic soils . About a third of mitigation
    potential in forestry can be achieved at a cost <20 USD/tCO2-eq emission. Demand-side
    measures, such as changes in diet and reductions of losses in the food supply
    chain, have a significant, but uncertain, potential to reduce GHG emissions from
    food production .  Bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but there
    are issues to consider, such as the sustainability of practices and the efficiency
    of bioenergy systems . Evidence suggests that bioenergy options with low lifecycle
    emissions, some already available, can reduce GHG emissions; outcomes are site-specific
    and rely on efficient integrated ‘biomassto-bioenergy systems’, and sustainable
    land use management and governance. Barriers to large-scale deployment of bioenergy
    include concerns about GHG emissions from land, food security, water resources,
    biodiversity conservation and livelihoods.  Mitigation measures intersect with
    other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side-effects.
    These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking
    climate mitigation actions . Mitigation can positively or negatively influence
    the achievement of other societal goals, such as those related to human health,
    food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods
    and equitable sustainable development . On the other hand, policies towards other
    societal goals can influence the achievement of mitigation and adaptation objectives.
    These influences can be substantial, although sometimes difficult to quantify,
    especially in welfare terms. This multi-objective perspective is important in
    part because it helps to identify areas where support for policies that advance
    multiple goals will be robust. Potential co-benefits and adverse side effects
    of the main sectoral mitigation measures are summarized in Table 4.5. Overall,
    the potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweigh the potential
    for adverse side effects, whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case
    for all energy supply and AFOLU measures.
  - 'Mitigation  There has been a considerable increase in national and subnational
    mitigation plans and strategies since AR4. In 2012, 67% of global GHG emissions
    were subject to national legislation or strategies versus 45% in 2007. However,
    there has not yet been a substantial deviation in global emissions from the past
    trend. These plans and strategies are in their early stages of development and
    implementation in many countries, making it difficult to assess their aggregate
    impact on future global emissions.  Since AR4, there has been an increased focus
    on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and
    reduce adverse side effects. Governments often explicitly reference co-benefits
    in climate and sectoral plans and strategies.  Sector-specific policies have been
    more widely used than economy-wide policies . Although most economic theory suggests
    that economy-wide policies for mitigation would be more cost-effective than sector-specific
    policies, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies
    harder to design and implement than sector-specific policies. The latter may be
    better suited to address barriers or market failures specific to certain sectors
    and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies  In principle, mechanisms
    that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can
    achieve mitigation in a cost-effective way, but have been implemented with diverse
    effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run
    environmental effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of
    loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries,
    tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology
    and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and gross
    domestic product . In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes have
    had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes . Revenues from carbon taxes
    or auctioned emission allowances are used in some countries to reduce other taxes
    and/or to provide transfers to low-income groups. This illustrates the general
    principle that mitigation policies that raise government revenue generally have
    lower social costs than approaches which do not.  Economic instruments in the
    form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy
    designs, such as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An
    increasing number and variety of RE policies including subsidies—motivated by
    many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years.
    Government policies play a crucial role in accelerating the deployment of RE technologies.
    Energy access and social and economic development have been the primary drivers
    in most developing countries whereas secure energy supply and environmental concerns
    have been most important in developed countries. The focus of policies is broadening
    from a concentration primarily on RE electricity to include RE heating and cooling
    and transportation.  The reduction of subsidies for GHG-related activities in
    various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic
    context. While subsidies can affect emissions in many sectors, most of the recent
    literature has focused on subsidies for fossil fuels. Since AR4 a small but growing
    literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of
    subsidies to fossil fuels in all countries could result in reductions in global
    aggregate emissions by mid-century . Studies vary in methodology, the type and
    definition of subsidies and the time frame for phase out considered. In particular,
    the studies assess the impacts of complete removal of all fossil fuel subsides
    without seeking to assess which subsidies are wasteful and inefficient, keeping
    in mind national circumstances.  Regulatory approaches and information measures
    are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory
    approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes
    include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions.  Mitigation
    policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters,
    but differences between regions and fuels exist. Most mitigation scenarios are
    associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade for major exporters.
    The effect on natural gas export revenues is more uncertain. The availability
    of CCS would reduce the adverse effect of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel
    assets.  Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic
    or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions . For instance, a carbon
    tax can have an additive environmental effect to policies such as subsidies for
    the supply of RE. By contrast, if a cap and trade system has a sufficiently stringent
    cap to affect emission-related decisions, then other policies have no further
    impact on reducing emissions  . In either case, additional policies may be needed
    to address market failures relating to innovation and technology diffusion.  Sub-national
    climate policies are increasingly prevalent, both in countries with national policies
    and in those without. These policies include state and provincial climate plans
    combining market, regulatory and information instruments, and sub-national cap-and-trade
    systems. In addition, transnational cooperation has arisen among sub-national
    actors, notably among institutional investors, NGOs seeking to govern carbon offset
    markets, and networks of cities seeking to collaborate in generating low-carbon
    urban development.  Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect
    achievement of other objectives such as those related to human health, food security,
    biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable
    sustainable development:  • Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm
    CO2-equivalent by 2100 show reduced costs for achieving air quality and energy
    security objectives, with significant co-benefits for human health, ecosystem
    impacts and sufficiency of resources and resilience of the energy system.  • Some
    mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper
    the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved
    populations . These potential adverse side effects can be avoided with the adoption
    of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer
    mechanisms. The costs of achieving nearly universal access to electricity and
    clean fuels for cooking and heating are projected to be between USD 72 to 95 billion
    per year until 2030 with minimal effects on GHG emissions and multiple benefits
    in health and air pollutant reduction.  Whether or not side effects materialize,
    and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific,
    and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation.
    Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified.'
  4.4q:
  - Technology development and transfer  Technology policy complements other mitigation
    policies across all scales from international to sub-national, but worldwide investment
    in research in support of GHG mitigation is small relative to overall public research
    spending. Technology policy includes technology-push and demand-pull . Such policies
    address a pervasive market failure because, in the absence of government policy
    such as patent protection, the invention of new technologies and practices from
    R&D efforts has aspects of a public good and thus tends to be under-provided by
    market forces alone. Technology support policies have promoted substantial innovation
    and diffusion of new technologies, but the cost-effectiveness of such policies
    is often difficult to assess. Technology policy can increase incentives for participation
    and compliance with international cooperative efforts, particularly in the long
    run.  Many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of
    technologies and management practices, but their effective use depends on a suitable
    institutional, regulatory, social and cultural context. Adaptation technologies
    are often familiar and already applied elsewhere. However, the success of technology
    transfer may involve not only the provision of finance and information, but also
    strengthening of policy and regulatory environments and capacities to absorb,
    employ and improve technologies appropriate to local circumstances.
  4.4r:
  - Investment and finance  Substantial reductions in emissions would require large
    changes in investment patterns. Mitigation scenarios in which policies stabilize
    atmospheric concentrations  in the range from 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 21004530
    lead to substantial shifts in annual investment flows during the period 2010–2029
    compared to baseline scenarios. Over the next two decades , annual investments
    in conventional fossil fuel technologies associated with the electricity supply
    sector are projected to decline in the scenarios by about USD 30 billion  while
    annual investment in low carbon electricity supply is projected to rise in the
    scenarios by about USD 147 billion  . In addition, annual incremental energy efficiency
    investments in transport, industry and buildings is projected to rise in the scenarios
    by about USD 336 billion. Global total annual investment in the energy system
    is presently about USD 1, billion. This number includes only energy supply of
    electricity and heat and respective upstream and downstream activities. Energy
    efficiency investment or underlying sector investment is not included.  There
    is no widely agreed definition of what constitutes climate finance, but estimates
    of the financial flows associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation
    are available. See Figure 4.5 for an overview of climate finance flows. Published
    assessments of all current annual financial flows whose expected effect is to
    reduce net GHG emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change and climate
    variability show USD 343 to 385 billion per year globally. Out of this, total
    public climate finance that flowed to developing countries is estimated to be
    between USD 35 and 49 billion per year in 2011 and 2012. Estimates of international
    private climate finance flowing to developing countries range from USD 10 to 72
    billion per year including foreign direct investment as equity and loans in the
    range of USD 10 to 37 billion per year over the period of 2008–2011.  In many
    countries, the private sector plays central roles in the processes that lead to
    emissions as well as to mitigation and adaptation. Within appropriate enabling
    environments, the private sector, along with the public sector, can play an important
    role in financing mitigation and adaptation . The share of total mitigation finance
    from the private sector, acknowledging data limitations, is estimated to be on
    average between two-thirds and three-fourths on the global level . In many countries,
    public finance interventions by governments and international development banks
    encourage climate investments by the private sector and provide finance where
    private sector investment is limited. The quality of a country’s enabling environment
    includes the effectiveness of its institutions, regulations and guidelines regarding
    the private sector, security of property rights, credibility of policies and other
    factors that have a substantial impact on whether private firms invest in new
    technologies and infrastructures. Dedicated policy instruments and financial arrangements,
    for example, credit insurance, feed-in tariffs, concessional finance or rebates
    provide an incentive for mitigation investment by improving the return adjusted
    for the risk for private actors. Public-private risk reduction initiatives  and
    economic diversification are examples of adaptation action enabling and relying
    on private sector participation.  Financial resources for adaptation have become
    available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and developing countries.
    Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs
    and the funds available for adaptation. Potential synergies between international
    finance for disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change have not
    yet been fully realized. There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation
    costs, funding and investment. Studies estimating the global cost of adaptation
    are characterized by shortcomings in data, methods and coverage .
  4.5a:
  - Interaction among mitigation, adaptation  and sustainable development Climate
    change is a threat to equitable and sustainable development. Adaptation, mitigation
    and sustainable development are closely related, with potential for synergies
    and trade-offs. Climate change poses an increasing threat to equitable and sustainable
    development. Some climate-related impacts on development are already being observed.
    Climate change is a threat multiplier. It exacerbates other threats to social
    and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor and constraining
    possible development paths for all. Development along current global pathways
    can contribute to climate risk and vulnerability, further eroding the basis for
    sustainable development.  Aligning climate policy with sustainable development
    requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation. Interaction among adaptation,
    mitigation and sustainable development occurs both within and across regions and
    scales, often in the context of multiple stressors. Some options for responding
    to climate change could impose risks of other environmental and social costs,
    have adverse distributional effects and draw resources away from other development
    priorities, including poverty eradication.  Both adaptation and mitigation can
    bring substantial co-benefits . Examples of actions with co-benefits include improved
    air quality; enhanced energy security, reduced energy and water consumption in
    urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable agriculture
    and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and other ecosystem
    services.  Strategies and actions can be pursued now that will move towards climate-resilient
    pathways for sustainable development, while at the same time helping to improve
    livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management.
    Prospects for climate-resilient pathways are related fundamentally to what the
    world accomplishes with climate change mitigation. Since mitigation reduces the
    rate as well as the magnitude of warming, it also increases the time available
    for adaptation to a particular level of climate change, potentially by several
    decades. Delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient
    pathways in the future.
  - Trade-offs, synergies and integrated responses  There are many opportunities to
    link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through
    integrated responses. Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suitable
    governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond. A growing evidence base
    indicates close links between adaptation and mitigation, their co-benefits and
    adverse side effects, and recognizes sustainable development as the overarching
    context for climate policy . Developing tools to address these linkages is critical
    to the success of climate policy in the context of sustainable development. This
    section presents examples of integrated responses in specific policy arenas, as
    well as some of the factors that promote or impede policies aimed at multiple
    objectives. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an
    increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health,
    water, energy, land use and biodiversity. Mitigation can support the achievement
    of other societal goals, such as those related to human health, food security,
    environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and sustainable development,
    although there can also be negative effects. Adaptation measures also have the
    potential to deliver mitigation co-benefits, and vice versa, and support other
    societal goals, though trade-offs can also arise.  Integration of adaptation and
    mitigation into planning and decision-making can create synergies with sustainable
    development. Synergies and trade-offs among mitigation and adaptation policies
    and policies advancing other societal goals can be substantial, although sometimes
    difficult to quantify especially in welfare terms. A multi-objective approach
    to policy-making can help manage these synergies and trade-offs. Policies advancing
    multiple goals may also attract greater support.  Effective integrated responses
    depend on suitable tools and governance structures, as well as adequate capacity
    . Managing trade-offs and synergies is challenging and requires tools to help
    understand interactions and support decision-making at local and regional scales.
    Integrated responses also depend on governance that enables coordination across
    scales and sectors, supported by appropriate institutions. Developing and implementing
    suitable tools and governance structures often requires upgrading the human and
    institutional capacity to design and deploy integrated responses.  An integrated
    approach to energy planning and implementation that explicitly assesses the potential
    for co-benefits and the presence of adverse side effects can capture complementarities
    across multiple climate, social and environmental objectives . There are strong
    interactive effects across various energy policy objectives, such as energy security,
    air quality, health and energy access and between a range of social and environmental
    objectives and climate mitigation objectives . An integrated approach can be assisted
    by tools such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria
    analysis and expected utility theory. It also requires appropriate coordinating
    institutions.  Explicit consideration of interactions among water, food, energy
    and biological carbon sequestration plays an important role in supporting effective
    decisions for climate resilient pathways . Both biofuel-based power generation
    and large-scale afforestation designed to mitigate climate change can reduce catchment
    run-off, which may conflict with alternative water uses for food production, human
    consumption or the maintenance of ecosystem function and services. Conversely,
    irrigation can increase the climate resilience of food and fibre production but
    reduces water availability for other uses.  An integrated response to urbanization
    provides substantial opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions
    and more sustainable development. Urban areas account for more than half of global
    primary energy use and energy-related CO2 emissions and contain a high proportion
    of the population and economic activities at risk from climate change. In rapidly
    growing and urbanizing regions, mitigation strategies based on spatial planning
    and efficient infrastructure supply can avoid the lock-in of high emission patterns.
    Mixed-use zoning, transport-oriented development, increased density and co-located
    jobs and homes can reduce direct and indirect energy use across sectors. Compact
    development of urban spaces and intelligent densification can preserve land carbon
    stocks and land for agriculture and bioenergy. Reduced energy and water consumption
    in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water are examples of mitigation
    actions with adaptation benefits. Building resilient infrastructure systems can
    reduce vulnerability of urban settlements and cities to coastal flooding, sea
    level rise and other climate-induced stresses.
  4.5b:
  - 'Foundations of decision-making  about climate change Effective decision-making
    to limit climate change and its effects can be informed by a wide range of analytical
    approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits, recognizing the importance
    of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments, economic assessments
    and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty. Sustainable development
    and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies. Limiting the effects
    of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity,
    including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contributions to the
    accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also face
    varying challenges and circumstances and have different capacities to address
    mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice
    and fairness and are necessary to achieve sustainable development and poverty
    eradication. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed
    and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from
    the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging impacts
    are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Both adaptation and
    mitigation can have distributional effects locally, nationally and internationally,
    depending on who pays and who benefits. The process of decision-making about climate
    change, and the degree to which it respects the rights and views of all those
    affected, is also a concern of justice.  Effective mitigation will not be achieved
    if individual agents advance their own interests independently. Climate change
    has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the global scale, because
    most GHGs accumulate over time and mix globally, and emissions by any agent affect
    other agents. Cooperative responses, including international cooperation, are
    therefore required to effectively mitigate GHG emissions and address other climate
    change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation can be enhanced through complementary
    actions across levels, including international cooperation. The evidence suggests
    that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective cooperation.  Decision-making
    about climate change involves valuation and mediation among diverse values and
    may be aided by the analytic methods of several normative disciplines. Ethics
    analyses the different values involved and the relations between them. Recent
    political philosophy has investigated the question of responsibility for the effects
    of emissions. Economics and decision analysis provide quantitative methods of
    valuation which can be used for estimating the social cost of carbon, in cost–benefit
    and costeffectiveness analyses, for optimization in integrated models and elsewhere.
    Economic methods can reflect ethical principles, and take account of non-marketed
    goods, equity, behavioural biases, ancillary benefits and costs and the differing
    values of money to different people. They are, however, subject to well-documented
    limitations.  Analytical methods of valuation cannot identify a single best balance
    between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts. Important reasons
    for this are that climate change involves extremely complex natural and social
    processes, there is extensive disagreement about the values concerned, and climate
    change impacts and mitigation approaches have important distributional effects.
    Nevertheless, information on the consequences of emissions pathways to alternative
    climate goals and risk levels can be a useful input into decision-making processes.
    Evaluating responses to climate change involves assessment of the widest possible
    range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large consequences.  Effective
    decision-making and risk management in the complex environment of climate change
    may be iterative: strategies can often be adjusted as new information and understanding
    develops during implementation. However, adaptation and mitigation choices in
    the near term will affect the risks of climate change throughout the 21st century
    and beyond, and prospects for climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development
    depend on what is achieved through mitigation. Opportunities to take advantage
    of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time,
    particularly if mitigation is delayed too long. Decision-making about climate
    change is influenced by how individuals and organizations perceive risks and uncertainties
    and take them into account. They sometimes use simplified decision rules, overestimate
    or underestimate risks and are biased towards the status quo. They differ in their
    degree of risk aversion and the relative importance placed on near-term versus
    long-term ramifications of specific actions. Formalized analytical methods for
    decision-making under uncertainty can account accurately for risk, and focus attention
    on both short- and long-term consequences.'

    air quality, health and energy access and between a range of social and environmental
    objectives and climate mitigation objectives . An integrated approach can be assisted
    by tools such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, multi-criteria
    analysis and expected utility theory. It also requires appropriate coordinating
    institutions.  Explicit consideration of interactions among water, food, energy
    and biological carbon sequestration plays an important role in supporting effective
    decisions for climate resilient pathways . Both biofuel-based power generation
    and large-scale afforestation designed to mitigate climate change can reduce catchment
    run-off, which may conflict with alternative water uses for food production, human
    consumption or the maintenance of ecosystem function and services. Conversely,
    irrigation can increase the climate resilience of food and fibre production but
    reduces water availability for other uses.  An integrated response to urbanization
    provides substantial opportunities for enhanced resilience, reduced emissions
    and more sustainable development. Urban areas account for more than half of global
    primary energy use and energy-related CO2 emissions and contain a high proportion
    of the population and economic activities at risk from climate change. In rapidly
    growing and urbanizing regions, mitigation strategies based on spatial planning
    and efficient infrastructure supply can avoid the lock-in of high emission patterns.
    Mixed-use zoning, transport-oriented development, increased density and co-located
    jobs and homes can reduce direct and indirect energy use across sectors. Compact
    development of urban spaces and intelligent densification can preserve land carbon
    stocks and land for agriculture and bioenergy. Reduced energy and water consumption
    in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water are examples of mitigation
    actions with adaptation benefits. Building resilient infrastructure systems can
    reduce vulnerability of urban settlements and cities to coastal flooding, sea
    level rise and other climate-induced stresses.

summaries:
  1.1a: Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s
    surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The  period from 1983 to 2012 was
    likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere,
    where such assessment is possible. The globally averaged combined land and ocean
    surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85
    [0.65 to 1.06] °C 2 over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple independently
    produced datasets exist.  In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally
    averaged surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability.
    Due to this natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive
    to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate
    trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years, which begins
    with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951.
  1.1b: Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system,
    accounting for more than 90% of the energy  accumulated between 1971 and 2010,
    with only about 1% stored in the atmosphere. On a global scale, the ocean warming
    is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13]
    °C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper
    ocean warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971.
  1.1c: Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation
    has increased since 1901 . For other latitudes, area-averaged long-term positive
    or negative trends have low confidence. Observations of changes in ocean surface
    salinity also provide indirect evidence for changes in the global water cycle
    over the ocean. It is very likely that regions of high salinity, where evaporation
    dominates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation
    dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s.
  1.1d: Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted
    in acidification of the ocean; the pH of ocean  surface water has decreased by
    0.1, corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration.
  1.1e: Over the period 1992 to 2011, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have
    been losing mass , likely at a  larger rate over 2002 to 2011. Glaciers have continued
    to shrink almost worldwide. Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued
    to decrease in extent. There is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have
    increased in most regions since the early 1980s in response to increased surface
    temperature and changing snow cover. The annual mean Arctic sea-ice extent decreased
    over the period 1979 to 2012, with a rate that was very likely in the range  3.5
    to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased in every season and in
    every successive decade since 1979, with the most rapid decrease in decadal mean
    extent in summer. It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea-ice extent
    increased in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. However,
    there is high confidence that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica,
    with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others.
  1.1g: Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to
    0.21] m . The rate of sea level rise  since the mid-19th century has been larger
    than the mean rate during the previous two millennia.
  1.2a: Anthropogenic greenhouse gas  emissions since the pre-industrial era have
    driven large increases in the atmospheric  concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane
    and nitrous oxide. Between 1750 and 2011, cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions
    to the atmosphere were 2040 ± 310 GtCO2. About 40% of these emissions have remained
    in the atmosphere; the rest was removed from the atmosphere and stored on land  and
    in the ocean. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2,
    causing ocean acidification. About half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions between
    1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years . Total anthropogenic GHG emissions
    have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between  2000
    and 2010, despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies. Anthropogenic
    GHG emissions in 2010 have reached 49 ± 4.5 GtCO2-eq/yr 3. Emissions of CO2 from
    fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total
    GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution
    for the increase during the period 2000 to 2010. Globally, economic and population
    growth continued to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions
    from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000
    and 2010 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution
    of economic growth has risen sharply. Increased use of coal has reversed the long-standing
    trend of gradual decarbonization  of the world’s energy supply.
  1.2c: The evidence for human influence on the climate system has grown since the
    IPCC Fourth Assessment Report . It is  extremely likely that more than half of
    the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010
    was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic
    forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming
    is similar to the observed warming over this period. Anthropogenic forcings have
    likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since
    the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica. Anthropogenic
    influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed
    to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting
    of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely
    contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial
    contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content and to global mean
    sea level rise observed since the 1970s.
  1.3a: Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive
    for natural systems. In many regions,  changing precipitation or melting snow
    and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms
    of quantity and quality. Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have
    shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances
    and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change . Some impacts
    on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or
    minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences. Assessment
    of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative
    impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts.
    Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed to
    human influence.
  1.4a: It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and
    the number of warm days and nights has increased  on the global scale. It is likely
    that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia
    and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed
    global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes
    since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled
    the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. There is medium
    confidence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality
    and decreased cold-related human mortality in some regions.  There are likely
    more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased
    than where it has decreased. Recent detection of increasing trends in extreme
    precipitation and discharge in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding
    at regional scale. It is likely that extreme sea levels  have increased since
    1970, being mainly a result of rising mean sea level.  Impacts from recent climate-related
    extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal
    significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems
    to current climate variability .
  2.1b: Anthropogenic GHG emissions are mainly driven by population size, economic
    activity, lifestyle, energy use, land use patterns,  technology and climate policy.
    The Representative Concentration Pathways, which are used for making projections
    based on these factors, describe four different 21st century pathways of GHG emissions
    and atmospheric concentrations, air pollutant emissions and land use. The RCPs
    include a stringent mitigation scenario, two intermediate scenarios and one scenario
    with very high GHG emissions. Scenarios without additional efforts to constrain
    emissions lead to pathways ranging between RCP6.0 and RCP8.5. RCP2.6 is representative
    of a scenario that aims to keep global warming likely below 2°C above pre-industrial
    temperatures. The RCPs are consistent with the wide range of scenarios in the
    literature as assessed by WGIII5.
  2.1c: Multiple lines of evidence indicate a strong, consistent, almost linear relationship
    between cumulative CO2 emissions and  projected global temperature change to the
    year 2100 in both the RCPs and the wider set of mitigation scenarios analysed
    in WGIII. Any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative
    CO2 emissions, and therefore, e.g., higher emissions in earlier decades imply
    lower emissions later.
  2.1d: Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to less
    than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with  a probability of >66%7 would require
    cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to remain below
    about 2900 GtCO2. About 1900 GtCO28 had already been emitted by 2011. For additional
    context see Table 2.2.
  2.2e: Changes in precipitation will not be uniform. The high latitudes and the equatorial
    Pacific are likely to experience an increase  in annual mean precipitation under
    the RCP8.5 scenario. In many mid-latitude and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation
    will likely decrease, while in many mid-latitude wet regions, mean precipitation
    will likely increase under the RCP8.5 scenario. Extreme precipitation events over
    most of the mid-latitude land masses and over wet tropical regions will very likely
    become more intense and more frequent.
  2.2f: The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century, with the strongest
    warming projected for the surface in  tropical and Northern Hemisphere subtropical
    regions.
  2.2g: Earth System Models project a global increase in ocean acidification for all
    RCP scenarios by the end of the 21st century, with  a slow recovery after mid-century
    under RCP2.6. The decrease in surface ocean pH is in the range of 0.06 to 0.07  for
    RCP2.6, 0.14 to 0.15 for RCP4.5, 0.20 to 0.21 for RCP6.0 and 0.30 to 0.32 for
    RCP8.5.
  2.2h: Year-round reductions in Arctic sea ice are projected for all RCP scenarios.
    A nearly ice-free11 Arctic Ocean in the summer sea-  ice minimum in September
    before mid-century is likely for RCP8.512. It is virtually certain that near-surface
    permafrost extent at high northern latitudes will be reduced as global mean surface  temperature
    increases, with the area of permafrost near the surface projected to decrease
    by 37% to 81% for the multi-model average. The global glacier volume, excluding
    glaciers on the periphery of Antarctica , is projected to decrease by 15 to 55%
    for RCP2.6 and by 35 to 85% for RCP8.5.
  2.2m: Summary for Policymakers13SPM  There has been significant improvement in understanding
    and projection of sea level change since the AR4. Global mean sea level rise will
    continue during the 21st century, very likely at a faster rate than observed from
    1971 to 2010. For the period 2081–2100 relative to 1986–2005, the rise will likely
    be in the ranges of 0.26 to 0.55 m for RCP2.6, and of 0.45 to 0.82 m for RCP8.5
    10. Sea level rise will not be uniform across regions. By the end of the 21st
    century, it is very likely that sea level will rise in more than about 95% of
    the ocean area. About 70% of the coastlines worldwide are projected to experience
    a sea level change within ±20% of the global mean.
  2.3a: Risk of climate-related impacts results from the interaction of climate-related
    hazards  with the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, including
    their ability to adapt. Rising rates and magnitudes of warming and other changes
    in the climate system, accompanied by ocean acidification, increase the risk of
    severe, pervasive and in some cases irreversible detrimental impacts. Some risks
    are particularly relevant for individual regions, while others are global. The
    overall risks of future climate change impacts can be reduced by limiting the
    rate and magnitude of climate change, including ocean acidification. The precise
    levels of climate change sufficient to trigger abrupt and irreversible change
    remain uncertain, but the risk associated with crossing such thresholds increases
    with rising temperature. For risk assessment, it is important to evaluate the
    widest possible range of impacts, including low-probability outcomes with large
    consequences.
  2.3b: A large fraction of species faces increased extinction risk due to climate
    change during and beyond the 21st century, espe-  cially as climate change interacts
    with other stressors. Most plant species cannot naturally shift their geographical
    ranges sufficiently fast to keep up with current and high projected rates of climate
    change in most landscapes; most small mammals and freshwater molluscs will not
    be able to keep up at the rates projected under RCP4.5 and above in flat landscapes
    in this century. Future risk is indicated to be high by the observation that natural
    global climate change at rates lower than current anthropogenic climate change
    caused significant ecosystem shifts and species extinctions during the past millions
    of years. Marine organisms will face progressively lower oxygen levels and high
    rates and magnitudes of ocean acidification, with associated risks exacerbated
    by rising ocean temperature extremes . Coral reefs and polar ecosystems are highly
    vulnerable. Coastal systems and low-lying areas are at risk from sea level rise,
    which will continue for centuries even if the global mean temperature is stabilized.
  2.3c: Climate change is projected to undermine food security . Due to projected
    climate change by the mid-21st century  and beyond, global marine species redistribution
    and marine biodiversity reduction in sensitive regions will challenge the sustained
    provision of fisheries productivity and other ecosystem services. For wheat, rice
    and maize in tropical and temperate regions, climate change without adaptation
    is projected to negatively impact production for local temperature increases of
    2°C or more above late 20th century levels, although individual locations may
    benefit. Global temperature increases of ~4°C or more above late 20th century
    levels, combined with increasing food demand, would pose large risks to food security
    globally. Climate change is projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater
    resources in most dry subtropical regions, intensifying competition for water
    among sectors. Rural areas are expected to experience major impacts on water availability
    and supply, food security, infrastructure and  agricultural incomes, including
    shifts in the production areas of food and non-food crops around the world.
  2.3e: Aggregate economic losses accelerate with increasing temperature , but global
    economic  impacts from climate change are currently difficult to estimate. From
    a poverty perspective, climate change impacts are projected to slow down economic
    growth, make poverty reduction more difficult, further erode food security and
    prolong existing and create new poverty traps, the latter particularly in urban
    areas and emerging hotspots of hunger . International dimensions such as trade
    and relations among states are also important for understanding the risks of climate
    change at regional scales.
  2.3f: Climate change is projected to increase displacement of people . Populations
    that lack  the resources for planned migration experience higher exposure to extreme
    weather events, particularly in developing countries with low income. Climate
    change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented
    drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks.
  2.4a: Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Surface
    temperatures will remain approximately  constant at elevated levels for many centuries
    after a complete cessation of net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. A large fraction
    of anthropogenic climate change resulting from CO2 emissions is irreversible on
    a multi-century to millennial timescale, except in the case of a large net removal
    of CO2 from the atmosphere over a sustained period.
  2.4b: Stabilization of global average surface temperature does not imply stabilization
    for all aspects of the climate system. Shifting  biomes, soil carbon, ice sheets,
    ocean temperatures and associated sea level rise all have their own intrinsic
    long timescales which will result in changes lasting hundreds to thousands of
    years after global surface temperature is stabilized.  There is high confidence
    that ocean acidification will increase for centuries if CO2 emissions continue,
    and will strongly affect marine ecosystems.
  2.4c: It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for
    many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise  dependent on future emissions.
    The threshold for the loss of the Greenland ice sheet over a millennium or more,
    and an associated sea level rise of up to 7 m, is greater than about 1°C but less
    than about 4°C of global warming with respect to pre-industrial temperatures.
    Abrupt and irreversible ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheet is possible, but
    current evidence and understanding is insufficient to make a quantitative assessment.
  2.4d: Magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission
    scenarios pose an increased risk of  abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change
    in the composition, structure and function of marine, terrestrial and freshwater
    ecosystems, including wetlands. A reduction in permafrost extent is virtually
    certain with continued rise in global temperatures.
  3.1a: Effective decision-making to limit climate change and its effects can be informed
    by a wide  range of analytical approaches for evaluating expected risks and benefits,
    recognizing the importance of governance, ethical dimensions, equity, value judgments,
    economic assessments and diverse perceptions and responses to risk and uncertainty.
  3.1b: Sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies.
    Limiting the effects of climate change is  necessary to achieve sustainable development
    and equity, including poverty eradication. Countries’ past and future contributions
    to the accumulation of GHGs in the atmosphere are different, and countries also
    face varying challenges and circumstances and have different capacities to address
    mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice
    and fairness. Many of those most vulnerable to climate change have contributed
    and contribute little to GHG emissions. Delaying mitigation shifts burdens from
    the present to the future, and insufficient adaptation responses to emerging impacts
    are already eroding the basis for sustainable development. Comprehensive strategies
    in response to climate change that are consistent with sustainable development
    take into account the co-benefits, adverse side effects and risks that may arise
    from both adaptation and mitigation options.
  3.1c: The design of climate policy is influenced by how individuals and organizations
    perceive risks and uncertainties and take  them into account. Methods of valuation
    from economic, social and ethical analysis are available to assist decision-making.
    These methods can take account of a wide range of possible impacts, including
    low-probability outcomes with large consequences. But they cannot identify a single
    best balance between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts.
  3.1d: Climate change has the characteristics of a collective action problem at the
    global scale, because most GHGs accumulate  over time and mix globally, and emissions
    by any agent affect other agents. Effective mitigation will not be achieved if
    individual agents advance their own interests independently. Cooperative responses,
    including international cooperation, are therefore required to effectively mitigate
    GHG emissions and address other climate change issues. The effectiveness of adaptation
    can be enhanced through complementary actions across levels, including international
    cooperation. The evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to
    more effective cooperation.
  3.2b: Mitigation and adaptation are complementary approaches for reducing risks
    of climate change impacts over different time-  scales. Mitigation, in the near
    term and through the century, can substantially reduce climate change impacts
    in the latter decades of the 21st century and beyond. Benefits from adaptation
    can already be realized in addressing current risks, and can be realized in the
    future for addressing emerging risks.
  3.2d: Without additional mitigation efforts beyond those in place today, and even
    with adaptation, warming by the end of the  21st century will lead to high to
    very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally . In most
    scenarios without additional mitigation efforts, warming is more likely than not
    to exceed 4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. The risks associated with temperatures
    at or above 4°C include substantial species extinction, global and regional food
    insecurity, consequential constraints on common human activities and limited potential
    for adaptation in some cases. Some risks of climate change, such as risks to unique
    and threatened systems and risks associated with extreme weather events, are moderate
    to high at temperatures 1°C to 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
  3.2e: Substantial cuts in GHG emissions over the next few decades can substantially
    reduce risks of climate change by limiting  warming in the second half of the
    21st century and beyond. Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global
    mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Limiting risks across
    RFCs would imply a limit for cumulative emissions of CO2. Such a limit would require
    that global net emissions of CO2 eventually decrease to zero and would constrain
    annual emissions over the next few decades. But some risks from climate damages
    are unavoidable, even with mitigation and adaptation.
  3.2f: Mitigation involves some level of co-benefits and risks, but these risks do
    not involve the same possibility of severe, wide-  spread and irreversible impacts
    as risks from climate change. Inertia in the economic and climate system and the
    possibility of irreversible impacts from climate change increase the benefits
    from near-term mitigation efforts. Delays in additional mitigation or constraints
    on technological options increase the longer-term mitigation costs to hold climate
    change risks at a given level.
  3.3a: Adaptation can contribute to the well-being of populations, the security of
    assets and the maintenance of ecosystem goods,  functions and services now and
    in the future. Adaptation is place- and context-specific. A first step towards
    adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to
    present climate variability. Integration of adaptation into planning, including
    policy design, and decision-making can promote synergies with development and
    disaster risk reduction. Building adaptive capacity is crucial for effective selection
    and implementation of adaptation options.
  3.3b: Adaptation planning and implementation can be enhanced through complementary
    actions across levels, from individuals to  governments. National governments
    can coordinate adaptation efforts of local and sub-national governments, for example
    by protecting vulnerable groups, by supporting economic diversification and by
    providing information, policy and legal frameworks and financial support. Local
    government and the private sector are increasingly recognized as critical to progress
    in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households
    and civil society and in managing risk information and financing.
  3.3c: Adaptation planning and implementation at all levels of governance are contingent
    on societal values, objectives and risk  perceptions. Recognition of diverse interests,
    circumstances, social-cultural contexts and expectations can benefit decision-making
    processes. Indigenous, local and traditional knowledge systems and practices,
    including indigenous peoples’ holistic view of community and environment, are
    a major resource for adapting to climate change, but these have not been used
    consistently in existing adaptation efforts. Integrating such forms of knowledge
    with existing practices increases the effectiveness of adaptation.
  3.3d: 'Constraints can interact to impede adaptation planning and implementation
    . Common constraints on  implementation arise from the following: limited financial
    and human resources; limited integration or coordination of governance; uncertainties
    about projected impacts; different perceptions of risks; competing values; absence
    of key adaptation leaders and advocates; and limited tools to monitor adaptation
    effectiveness. Another constraint includes insufficient research, monitoring,
    and observation and the finance to maintain them. Greater rates and magnitude
    of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits .  Limits
    to adaptation emerge from the interaction among climate change and biophysical
    and/or socio-economic constraints. Further, poor planning or implementation, overemphasizing
    short-term outcomes or failing to sufficiently anticipate consequences can result
    in maladaptation, increasing the vulnerability or exposure of the target group
    in the future or the vulnerability of other people, places or sectors. Underestimating
    the complexity of adaptation as a social process can create unrealistic expectations
    about achieving intended adaptation outcomes.'
  3.3f: Significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs exist between mitigation
    and adaptation and among different adap-  tation responses; interactions occur
    both within and across regions. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate
    change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, particularly at the intersections
    among water, energy, land use and biodiversity, but tools to understand and manage
    these interactions remain limited. Examples of actions with co-benefits include
    improved energy efficiency and cleaner energy sources, leading to reduced emissions
    of health-damaging, climate-altering air pollutants; reduced energy and water
    consumption in urban areas through greening cities and recycling water; sustainable
    agriculture and forestry; and protection of ecosystems for carbon storage and
    other ecosystem services.
  3.3g: Transformations in economic, social, technological and political decisions
    and actions can enhance adaptation and promote  sustainable development. At the
    national level, transformation is considered most effective when it reflects a
    country’s own visions and approaches to achieving sustainable development in accordance
    with its national circumstances and priorities. Restricting adaptation responses
    to incremental changes to existing systems and structures, without considering
    transformational change, may increase costs and losses and miss opportunities.
    Planning and implementation of transformational adaptation could reflect strengthened,
    altered or aligned paradigms and may place new and increased demands on governance
    structures to reconcile different goals and visions for the future and to address
    possible equity and ethical implications. Adaptation pathways are enhanced by
    iterative learning, deliberative processes and innovation.
  3.4a: There are multiple mitigation pathways that are likely to limit warming to
    below 2°C relative  to pre-industrial levels. These pathways would require substantial
    emissions reductions over the next few decades and near zero emissions of CO2
    and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century. Implementing
    such reductions poses substantial technological, economic, social and institutional
    challenges, which increase with delays in additional mitigation and if key technologies
    are not available. Limiting warming to lower or higher levels involves similar
    challenges but on different timescales.
  3.4b: Without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond those in place today,
    global emissions growth is expected to  persist, driven by growth in global population
    and economic activities. Global mean surface temperature increases in 2100 in
    baseline scenarios—those without additional mitigation—range from 3.7°C to 4.8°C
    above the average for 1850–1900 for a median climate response. They range from
    2.5°C to 7.8°C when including climate uncertainty  .
  3.4c: Emissions scenarios leading to CO2-equivalent concentrations in 2100 of about
    450 ppm or lower are likely to maintain  warming below 2°C over the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels. These scenarios are characterized by 40 to
    70% global anthropogenic GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 201016,
    and emissions levels near zero or below in 2100. Mitigation scenarios reaching
    concentration levels of about 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 are more likely than not
    to limit temperature change to less than 2°C, unless they temporarily overshoot
    concentration levels of roughly 530 ppm CO2-eq before 2100, in which case they
    are about as likely as not to achieve that goal. In these 500 ppm CO2-eq scenarios,
    global 2050 emissions levels are 25 to 55% lower than in 2010. Scenarios with
    higher emissions in 2050 are characterized by a greater reliance on Carbon Dioxide
    Removal technologies beyond mid-century. Trajectories that are likely to limit
    warming to 3°C relative to pre-industrial levels reduce emissions less rapidly
    than those limiting warming to 2°C. A limited number of studies provide scenarios
    that are more likely than not to limit warming to 1.5°C by 2100; these scenarios
    are characterized by concentrations below 430 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 and 2050 emission
    reduction between 70% and 95% below 2010. For a comprehensive overview of the
    characteristics of emissions scenarios, their CO2-equivalent concentrations and
    their likelihood to keep warming to below a range of temperature levels, see Figure
    SPM.11 and Table SPM.1.
  3.4d: Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO2-eq in 2100  typically involve
    temporary overshoot of atmospheric concentrations, as do many scenarios reaching
    about 500 ppm CO2-eq to about 550 ppm CO2-eq in 2100. Depending on the level of
    overshoot, overshoot scenarios typically rely on the availability and widespread
    deployment of bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage and afforestation
    in the second half of the century. The availability and scale of these and other
    CDR technologies and methods are uncertain and CDR technologies are, to varying
    degrees, associated with challenges and risks. CDR is also prevalent in many scenarios
    without overshoot to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation
    is more expensive.
  3.4e: Reducing emissions of non-CO2 agents can be an important element of mitigation
    strategies. All current GHG emissions  and other forcing agents affect the rate
    and magnitude of climate change over the next few decades, although long-term
    warming is mainly driven by CO2 emissions. Emissions of non-CO2 forcers are often
    expressed as ‘CO2-equivalent emissions’, but the choice of metric to calculate
    these emissions, and the implications for the emphasis and timing of abatement
    of the various climate forcers, depends on application and policy context and
    contains value judgments.
  3.4f: Delaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges
    associated with limiting warming over the  21st century to below 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels. It will require substantially higher rates of emissions
    reductions from 2030 to 2050; a much more rapid scale-up of low-carbon energy
    over this period; a larger reliance on CDR in the long term; and higher transitional
    and long-term economic impacts. Estimated global emissions levels in 2020 based
    on the Cancún Pledges are not consistent with cost-effective mitigation trajectories
    that are at least about as likely as not to limit warming to below 2°C relative
    to pre-industrial levels, but they do not preclude the option to meet this goal
    .
  3.4g: Estimates of the aggregate economic costs of mitigation vary widely depending
    on methodologies and assumptions, but  increase with the stringency of mitigation.
    Scenarios in which all countries of the world begin mitigation immediately, in
    which there is a single global carbon price, and in which all key technologies
    are available have been used as a cost-effective benchmark for estimating macro-economic
    mitigation costs. Under these assumptions mitigation scenarios that are likely
    to limit warming to below 2°C through the 21st century relative to pre-industrial
    levels entail losses in global consumption—not including benefits of reduced climate
    change as well as co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation—of 1 to 4%
    in 2030, 2 to 6% in 2050 and 3 to 11% in 2100 relative to consumption in baseline
    scenarios that grows anywhere from 300% to more than 900% over the century. These
    numbers correspond to an annualized reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 to
    0.14 percentage points over the century relative to annualized consumption growth
    in the baseline that is between 1.6 and 3% per year .
  3.4h: In the absence or under limited availability of mitigation technologies ,
    mitigation costs can increase substantially depending on the technology considered.
    Delaying additional mitigation increases mitigation costs in the medium to long
    term. Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2°C over the 21st century
    relative to pre-industrial levels if additional mitigation is considerably delayed.
    Many models could not limit likely warming to below 2°C if bioenergy, CCS and
    their combination are limited .
  3.4i: Mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 or 500 ppm CO2-eq by 2100 show reduced
    costs for achieving air quality and energy  security objectives, with significant
    co-benefits for human health, ecosystem impacts and sufficiency of resources and
    resilience of the energy system.
  3.4l: Mitigation policy could devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for
    fossil fuel exporters, but differences between regions  and fuels exist. Most
    mitigation scenarios are associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade
    for major exporters. The availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effects
    of mitigation on the value of fossil fuel assets.
  4.1a: Adaptation and mitigation responses are underpinned by common enabling factors.
    These  include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments
    in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods
    and behavioural and lifestyle choices. For many regions and sectors, enhanced
    capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing  climate
    change risks. Improving institutions as well as coordination and cooperation in
    governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation,
    adaptation and disaster risk reduction.
  4.1b: Inertia in many aspects of the socio-economic system constrains adaptation
    and mitigation options . Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure
    and technologies can reduce GHG emissions and enhance resilience to climate change.
  4.1c: Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions and the capacity for adaptation
    and mitigation are strongly influenced by  livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour
    and culture. Also, the social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies
    are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally
    appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours.
  4.2a: Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation
    and potential to  reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions.
    Some adaptation responses involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs.
    Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options.
  4.2b: Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public and private
    sectors and within communities. There is  increasing recognition of the value
    of social, institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints
    to adaptation. Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with
    more limited implementation of responses.
  4.2c: The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase
    with climate change .  Adaptation options exist in all sectors and regions, with
    diverse potential and approaches depending on their context in vulnerability reduction,
    disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning. Effective strategies
    and actions consider the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider
    strategic goals and development plans.
  4.3a: Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be
    more cost-effective  if using an integrated approach that combines measures to
    reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize
    energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors.  Well-designed
    systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting
    emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors, with efforts in
    one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others . Mitigation measures intersect
    with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse
    side effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for
    undertaking climate action. Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important
    element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more  flexibility for
    reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side
    risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures, and are associated with
    important co-benefits. The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry
    are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with
    large differences in their relative importance across regions; and in agriculture,
    cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic soils.
  4.3b: Emissions ranges for baseline scenarios and mitigation scenarios that limit
    CO2-equivalent concentrations to low levels  are shown for different sectors and
    gases in Figure SPM.14. Key measures to achieve such mitigation goals include
    decarbonizing electricity generation as well as efficiency enhancements and behavioural
    changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without
    compromising development . In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations
    by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline
    over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below
    2010 levels between 2040 and 2070. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization
    scenarios , the share of low-carbon electricity supply , nuclear and carbon dioxide
    capture and storage including bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage
    ) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050,
    and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by
    2100.
  4.3d: Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use
    and associated emissions, with high mitigation  potential in some sectors, in
    particular when complementing technological and structural change . Emissions
    can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns, adoption
    of energy savings measures, dietary change and reduction in food wastes.
  4.4b: 'International cooperation is critical for effective mitigation, even though
    mitigation can also have local co-benefits. Adapta-  tion focuses primarily on
    local to national scale outcomes, but its effectiveness can be enhanced through
    coordination across governance scales, including international cooperation: •
    The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  is the main multilateral
    forum focused on  addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation.
    Other institutions organized at different levels of governance have resulted in
    diversifying international climate change cooperation. • The Kyoto Protocol offers
    lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with
    respect to  participation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms and environmental
    effectiveness . • Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate
    policies offer potential climate change mitigation ben-  efits. Potential advantages
    include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market
    liquidity. International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation
    has received less attention histori-  cally than mitigation but is increasing
    and has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at
    the national, sub-national and local level.'
  4.4g: 'There has been a considerable increase in national and sub-national plans
    and strategies on both adaptation and mitigation  since the AR4, with an increased
    focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits
    and reduce adverse side effects: • National governments play key roles in adaptation
    planning and implementation   through coordinating actions and providing frameworks
    and support. While local government and the private sector have different functions,
    which vary regionally, they are increasingly recognized as critical to progress
    in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households
    and civil society and in managing risk information and financing. • Institutional
    dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into
    planning and decision-  making, play a key role in promoting the transition from
    planning to implementation of adaptation. Examples of institutional approaches
    to adaptation involving multiple actors include economic options , laws and regulations
    and national and government policies and programmes.'
  4.4l: • In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade
    systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitiga-  tion in a cost-effective way but
    have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances
    as well as policy design. The short-run effects of cap and trade systems have
    been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining.
    In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside
    technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions
    and GDP. In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes  have had effects
    that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes.
  4.4m: • Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often
    environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency
    standards; examples of information programmes include labelling programmes that
    can help consumers make better-informed decisions.
  4.4n: • Sector-specific mitigation policies have been more widely used than economy-wide
    policies . Sector-specific policies may be better suited to address sector-specific
    barriers or market failures and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies.
    Although theoretically more cost-effective, administrative and political barriers
    may make economy-wide policies harder to implement. Interactions between or among
    mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing
    emissions. • Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across
    sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such  as tax rebates or exemptions,
    grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of renewable
    energy policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated
    growth of RE technologies in recent years. At the same time, reducing subsidies
    for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions,
    depending on the social and economic context.
  4.4p: Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement
    of other objectives such as those related to  human health, food security, biodiversity,
    local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable
    development. The potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweighs
    the potential for adverse side effects whereas the evidence suggests this may
    not be the case for all energy supply and agriculture, forestry and other land
    use measures. Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services
    and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services
    to underserved populations. These potential adverse side effects on energy access
    can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax
    rebates or other benefit transfer mechanisms. Whether or not side effects materialize,
    and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific,
    and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation.
    Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified.
  4.4q: Technology policy  complements other mitigation policies across all scales,
    from international to sub-national; many adaptation efforts also critically
    rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management practices. Policies
    exist to address market failures in R&D, but the effective use of technologies
    can also depend on capacities to adopt technologies appropriate to local circumstances.
  4.4r: Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment
    patterns . For mitigation  scenarios that stabilize concentrations in the range
    of 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 210019, annual investments in low carbon electricity
    supply and energy efficiency in key sectors are projected in the scenarios to
    rise by several hundred billion dollars per year before 2030. Within appropriate
    enabling environments, the private sector, along with the public sector, can play
    important roles in financing mitigation and adaptation . Financial resources for
    adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed
    and developing  countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between
    global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation. There is a need
    for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment. Potential
    synergies between international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation
    have not yet been fully realized .
  4.5a: Climate change is a threat to sustainable development. Nonetheless, there
    are many opportu-  nities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other
    societal objectives through integrated responses. Successful implementation relies
    on relevant tools, suitable governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond.
  4.5b: Climate change exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing
    additional burdens particularly on the poor  . Aligning climate policy with sustainable
    development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation . Delaying global
    mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways and adaptation
    in the future. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation
    and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are
    exceeded. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an
    increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health,
    water, energy, land use and biodiversity .
