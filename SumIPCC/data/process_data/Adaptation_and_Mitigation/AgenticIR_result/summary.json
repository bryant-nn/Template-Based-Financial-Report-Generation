    "sub section 1.1": "Current best practices for enabling mitigation efforts include increasing incentives for participation, facilitating technology transfer and adaptation, integrating climate considerations into broader development plans, and recognizing social and institutional measures as part of the adaptation strategy. Collaboration across scales and learning from experiences can enhance the effectiveness of these strategies. Mechanisms that increase resilience of communities to climate change impacts include strengthening community networks, developing effective governance structures, and utilizing ecosystem-based approaches to provide natural services. Local governance can support adaptation strategies by aligning local efforts with national policies, protecting vulnerable groups, promoting economic diversification, and providing necessary information and resources."
