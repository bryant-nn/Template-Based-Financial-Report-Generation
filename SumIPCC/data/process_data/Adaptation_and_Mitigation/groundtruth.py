These  include effective institutions and governance, innovation and investments in environmentally sound technologies and infrastructure, sustainable livelihoods and behavioural and lifestyle choices. For many regions and sectors, enhanced capacities to mitigate and adapt are part of the foundation essential for managing  climate change risks. Improving institutions as well as coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction."),
    (("Common enabling factors and constraints for adaptation and mitigation responses", "Factors of Vulnerability"), "Vulnerability to climate change, GHG emissions and the capacity for adaptation and mitigation are strongly influenced by  livelihoods, lifestyles, behaviour and culture. Also, the social acceptability and/or effectiveness of climate policies are influenced by the extent to which they incentivize or depend on regionally appropriate changes in lifestyles or behaviours."),

Innovation and investments in environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies can reduce GHG emissions and enhance resilience to climate change."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "Carbon Tax"), "• In principle, mechanisms that set a carbon price, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, can achieve mitiga-  tion in a cost-effective way but have been implemented with diverse effects due in part to national circumstances as well as policy design. The short-run effects of cap and trade systems have been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining. In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and GDP. In addition, in a large group of countries, fuel taxes  have had effects that are akin to sectoral carbon taxes."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "Co-benefits and Side Effects"), "Co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation could affect achievement of other objectives such as those related to  human health, food security, biodiversity, local environmental quality, energy access, livelihoods and equitable sustainable development. The potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures outweighs the potential for adverse side effects whereas the evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and agriculture, forestry and other land use measures. Some mitigation policies raise the prices for some energy services and could hamper the ability of societies to expand access to modern energy services to underserved populations. These potential adverse side effects on energy access can be avoided with the adoption of complementary policies such as income tax rebates or other benefit transfer mechanisms. Whether or not side effects materialize, and to what extent side effects materialize, will be case- and site-specific, and depend on local circumstances and the scale, scope and pace of implementation. Many co-benefits and adverse side effects have not been well-quantified."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "Financial Solutions"), "Substantial reductions in emissions would require large changes in investment patterns . For mitigation  scenarios that stabilize concentrations in the range of 430 to 530 ppm CO2-eq by 210019, annual investments in low carbon electricity supply and energy efficiency in key sectors are projected in the scenarios to rise by several hundred billion dollars per year before 2030. Within appropriate enabling environments, the private sector, along with the public sector, can play important roles in financing mitigation and adaptation . Financial resources for adaptation have become available more slowly than for mitigation in both developed and developing  countries. Limited evidence indicates that there is a gap between global adaptation needs and the funds available for adaptation. There is a need for better assessment of global adaptation costs, funding and investment. Potential synergies between international finance for disaster risk management and adaptation have not yet been fully realized ."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "International Cooperation"), "International cooperation is critical for effective mitigation, even though mitigation can also have local co-benefits. Adapta-  tion focuses primarily on local to national scale outcomes, but its effectiveness can be enhanced through coordination across governance scales, including international cooperation: • The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  is the main multilateral forum focused on  addressing climate change, with nearly universal participation. Other institutions organized at different levels of governance have resulted in diversifying international climate change cooperation. • The Kyoto Protocol offers lessons towards achieving the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC, particularly with respect to  participation, implementation, flexibility mechanisms and environmental effectiveness . • Policy linkages among regional, national and sub-national climate policies offer potential climate change mitigation ben-  efits. Potential advantages include lower mitigation costs, decreased emission leakage and increased market liquidity. International cooperation for supporting adaptation planning and implementation has received less attention histori-  cally than mitigation but is increasing and has assisted in the creation of adaptation strategies, plans and actions at the national, sub-national and local level."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "National Strategies"), "There has been a considerable increase in national and sub-national plans and strategies on both adaptation and mitigation  since the AR4, with an increased focus on policies designed to integrate multiple objectives, increase co-benefits and reduce adverse side effects: • National governments play key roles in adaptation planning and implementation   through coordinating actions and providing frameworks and support. While local government and the private sector have different functions, which vary regionally, they are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation, given their roles in scaling up adaptation of communities, households and civil society and in managing risk information and financing. • Institutional dimensions of adaptation governance, including the integration of adaptation into planning and decision-  making, play a key role in promoting the transition from planning to implementation of adaptation. Examples of institutional approaches to adaptation involving multiple actors include economic options , laws and regulations and national and government policies and programmes."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "Regulatory Approaches and Information Measures"), "• Regulatory approaches and information measures are widely used and are often environmentally effective . Examples of regulatory approaches include energy efficiency standards; examples of information programmes include labelling programmes that can help consumers make better-informed decisions."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "Sector Policies"), "• Sector-specific mitigation policies have been more widely used than economy-wide policies . Sector-specific policies may be better suited to address sector-specific barriers or market failures and may be bundled in packages of complementary policies. Although theoretically more cost-effective, administrative and political barriers may make economy-wide policies harder to implement. Interactions between or among mitigation policies may be synergistic or may have no additive effect on reducing emissions. • Economic instruments in the form of subsidies may be applied across sectors, and include a variety of policy designs, such  as tax rebates or exemptions, grants, loans and credit lines. An increasing number and variety of renewable energy policies including subsidies—motivated by many factors—have driven escalated growth of RE technologies in recent years. At the same time, reducing subsidies for GHG-related activities in various sectors can achieve emission reductions, depending on the social and economic context."),
    (("Policy approaches for adaptation and mitigation, technology and finance", "Technological Solutions"), "Technology policy  complements other mitigation policies across all scales, from international to sub-national; many adaptation efforts also critically rely on diffusion and transfer of technologies and management practices. Policies exist to address market failures in R&D, but the effective use of technologies can also depend on capacities to adopt technologies appropriate to local circumstances."),
    (("Response options for adaptation", "Adaptation Adoption"), "Adaptation experience is accumulating across regions in the public and private sectors and within communities. There is  increasing recognition of the value of social, institutional, and ecosystem-based measures and of the extent of constraints to adaptation. Adaptation is becoming embedded in some planning processes, with more limited implementation of responses."),
    (("Response options for adaptation", "Adaptation Options"), "Adaptation options exist in all sectors, but their context for implementation and potential to  reduce climate-related risks differs across sectors and regions. Some adaptation responses involve significant co-benefits, synergies and trade-offs. Increasing climate change will increase challenges for many adaptation options."),
    (("Response options for adaptation", "Need for Adaptation"), "The need for adaptation along with associated challenges is expected to increase with climate change .  Adaptation options exist in all sectors and regions, with diverse potential and approaches depending on their context in vulnerability reduction, disaster risk management or proactive adaptation planning. Effective strategies and actions consider the potential for co-benefits and opportunities within wider strategic goals and development plans."),
    (("Response options for mitigations", "Impact of Behaviour"), "Behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions, with high mitigation  potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change . Emissions can be substantially lowered through changes in consumption patterns, adoption of energy savings measures, dietary change and reduction in food wastes."),
    (("Response options for mitigations", "Mitigation Options"), "Mitigation options are available in every major sector. Mitigation can be more cost-effective  if using an integrated approach that combines measures to reduce energy use and the greenhouse gas intensity of end-use sectors, decarbonize energy supply, reduce net emissions and enhance carbon sinks in land-based sectors.  Well-designed systemic and cross-sectoral mitigation strategies are more cost-effective in cutting emissions than a focus on individual technologies and sectors, with efforts in one sector affecting the need for mitigation in others . Mitigation measures intersect with other societal goals, creating the possibility of co-benefits or adverse side effects. These intersections, if well-managed, can strengthen the basis for undertaking climate action. Near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies, provide more  flexibility for reducing carbon intensity in the energy supply sector, hedge against related supply-side risks, avoid lock-in to carbon-intensive infrastructures, and are associated with important co-benefits. The most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are afforestation, sustainable forest management and reducing deforestation, with large differences in their relative importance across regions; and in agriculture, cropland management, grazing land management and restoration of organic soils."),
    (("Response options for mitigations", "Mitigation Scenarios"), "Emissions ranges for baseline scenarios and mitigation scenarios that limit CO2-equivalent concentrations to low levels  are shown for different sectors and gases in Figure SPM.14. Key measures to achieve such mitigation goals include decarbonizing electricity generation as well as efficiency enhancements and behavioural changes, in order to reduce energy demand compared to baseline scenarios without compromising development . In scenarios reaching 450 ppm CO2-eq concentrations by 2100, global CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to decline over the next decade and are characterized by reductions of 90% or more below 2010 levels between 2040 and 2070. In the majority of low-concentration stabilization scenarios , the share of low-carbon electricity supply , nuclear and carbon dioxide capture and storage including bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage ) increases from the current share of approximately 30% to more than 80% by 2050, and fossil fuel power generation without CCS is phased out almost entirely by 2100."),

Nonetheless, there are many opportu-  nities to link mitigation, adaptation and the pursuit of other societal objectives through integrated responses. Successful implementation relies on relevant tools, suitable governance structures and enhanced capacity to respond."),
    (("Trade-offs, synergies and interactions with sustainable development", "Tackling Climate Change"), "Climate change exacerbates other threats to social and natural systems, placing additional burdens particularly on the poor  . Aligning climate policy with sustainable development requires attention to both adaptation and mitigation . Delaying global mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways and adaptation in the future. Opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded. Increasing efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change imply an increasing complexity of interactions, encompassing connections among human health, water, energy, land use and biodiversity ."),
