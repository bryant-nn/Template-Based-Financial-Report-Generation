    (("Causes of climate change", "Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions"), "Anthropogenic greenhouse gas  emissions since the pre-industrial era have driven large increases in the atmospheric  concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Between 1750 and 2011, cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere were 2040 ± 310 GtCO2. About 40% of these emissions have remained in the atmosphere; the rest was removed from the atmosphere and stored on land  and in the ocean. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification. About half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years . Total anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between  2000 and 2010, despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies. Anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010 have reached 49 ± 4.5 GtCO2-eq/yr 3. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution for the increase during the period 2000 to 2010. Globally, economic and population growth continued to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply. Increased use of coal has reversed the long-standing trend of gradual decarbonization  of the world’s energy supply."),
    (("Causes of climate change", "Human Influence on Climate Change"), "The evidence for human influence on the climate system has grown since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report . It is  extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in GHG concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together. The best estimate of the human-induced contribution to warming is similar to the observed warming over this period. Anthropogenic forcings have likely made a substantial contribution to surface temperature increases since the mid-20th century over every continental region except Antarctica. Anthropogenic influences have likely affected the global water cycle since 1960 and contributed to the retreat of glaciers since the 1960s and to the increased surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet since 1993. Anthropogenic influences have very likely contributed to Arctic sea-ice loss since 1979 and have very likely made a substantial contribution to increases in global upper ocean heat content and to global mean sea level rise observed since the 1970s."),
    (("Extreme events", "Extreme Events"), "It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased  on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. There is medium confidence that the observed warming has increased heat-related human mortality and decreased cold-related human mortality in some regions.  There are likely more land regions where the number of heavy precipitation events has increased than where it has decreased. Recent detection of increasing trends in extreme precipitation and discharge in some catchments implies greater risks of flooding at regional scale. It is likely that extreme sea levels  have increased since 1970, being mainly a result of rising mean sea level.  Impacts from recent climate-related extremes, such as heat waves, droughts, floods, cyclones and wildfires, reveal significant vulnerability and exposure of some ecosystems and many human systems to current climate variability ."),
    (("Impacts of climate change", "Impacts of Climate Change"), "Evidence of observed climate change impacts is strongest and most comprehensive for natural systems. In many regions,  changing precipitation or melting snow and ice are altering hydrological systems, affecting water resources in terms of quantity and quality. Many terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have shifted their geographic ranges, seasonal activities, migration patterns, abundances and species interactions in response to ongoing climate change . Some impacts on human systems have also been attributed to climate change, with a major or minor contribution of climate change distinguishable from other influences. Assessment of many studies covering a wide range of regions and crops shows that negative impacts of climate change on crop yields have been more common than positive impacts. Some impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms have been attributed to human influence."),
    (("Observed changes in the climate system", "Acidification"), "Since the beginning of the industrial era, oceanic uptake of CO2 has resulted in acidification of the ocean; the pH of ocean  surface water has decreased by 0.1, corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity, measured as hydrogen ion concentration."),
    (("Observed changes in the climate system", "Climate Change Trend"), "Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. The  period from 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years in the Northern Hemisphere, where such assessment is possible. The globally averaged combined land and ocean surface temperature data as calculated by a linear trend show a warming of 0.85 [0.65 to 1.06] °C 2 over the period 1880 to 2012, when multiple independently produced datasets exist.  In addition to robust multi-decadal warming, the globally averaged surface temperature exhibits substantial decadal and interannual variability. Due to this natural variability, trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends. As one example, the rate of warming over the past 15 years, which begins with a strong El Niño, is smaller than the rate calculated since 1951."),
    (("Observed changes in the climate system", "Ice Melting"), "Over the period 1992 to 2011, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass , likely at a  larger rate over 2002 to 2011. Glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide. Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover has continued to decrease in extent. There is high confidence that permafrost temperatures have increased in most regions since the early 1980s in response to increased surface temperature and changing snow cover. The annual mean Arctic sea-ice extent decreased over the period 1979 to 2012, with a rate that was very likely in the range  3.5 to 4.1% per decade. Arctic sea-ice extent has decreased in every season and in every successive decade since 1979, with the most rapid decrease in decadal mean extent in summer. It is very likely that the annual mean Antarctic sea-ice extent increased in the range of 1.2 to 1.8% per decade between 1979 and 2012. However, there is high confidence that there are strong regional differences in Antarctica, with extent increasing in some regions and decreasing in others."),
    (("Observed changes in the climate system", "Ocean Warming"), "Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy  accumulated between 1971 and 2010, with only about 1% stored in the atmosphere. On a global scale, the ocean warming is largest near the surface, and the upper 75 m warmed by 0.11 [0.09 to 0.13] °C per decade over the period 1971 to 2010. It is virtually certain that the upper ocean warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971."),
    (("Observed changes in the climate system", "Precipitations and Ocean Salinity"), "Averaged over the mid-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere, precipitation has increased since 1901 . For other latitudes, area-averaged long-term positive or negative trends have low confidence. Observations of changes in ocean surface salinity also provide indirect evidence for changes in the global water cycle over the ocean. It is very likely that regions of high salinity, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s."),
    (("Observed changes in the climate system", "Sea Level"), "Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m . The rate of sea level rise  since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia."),
