Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to altered hydrological systems, increasing the risk of regional flooding due to changes in water discharge in catchments. This can result in greater flood damage costs worldwide. Additionally, altered salinity levels can affect freshwater availability, impacting ecosystems and human water supply. These changes contribute to the increased frequency and intensity of weather extremes, such as floods and droughts, exacerbating the challenges in managing water resources and increasing the vulnerability of both natural and human systems."

Observations of changes in ocean surface salinity also provide indirect evidence for changes in the global water cycle over the ocean. It is very likely that regions of high salinity, where evaporation dominates, have become more saline, while regions of low salinity, where precipitation dominates, have become fresher since the 1950s.",
