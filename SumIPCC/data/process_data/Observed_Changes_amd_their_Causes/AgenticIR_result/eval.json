      "Reference Summary": "Anthropogenic greenhouse gas  emissions since the pre-industrial era have driven large increases in the atmospheric  concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Between 1750 and 2011, cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere were 2040 ± 310 GtCO2. About 40% of these emissions have remained in the atmosphere; the rest was removed from the atmosphere and stored on land  and in the ocean. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic CO2, causing ocean acidification. About half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2011 have occurred in the last 40 years . Total anthropogenic GHG emissions have continued to increase over 1970 to 2010 with larger absolute increases between  2000 and 2010, despite a growing number of climate change mitigation policies. Anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2010 have reached 49 ± 4.5 GtCO2-eq/yr 3. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributed about 78% of the total GHG emissions increase from 1970 to 2010, with a similar percentage contribution for the increase during the period 2000 to 2010. Globally, economic and population growth continued to be the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The contribution of population growth between 2000 and 2010 remained roughly identical to the previous three decades, while the contribution of economic growth has risen sharply. Increased use of coal has reversed the long-standing trend of gradual decarbonization  of the world’s energy supply.",

      "Generated Summary": "Projections indicate that sea levels are rising at an increasing rate, primarily due to glacier mass loss and thermal expansion of ocean waters. Mean sea level rose approximately 1.7 mm per year from 1901 to 2010, accelerating to about 3.2 mm annually from 1993 to 2010. This trend suggests serious implications for coastal populations and ecosystems as climate change progresses.",
