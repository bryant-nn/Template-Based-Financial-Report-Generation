    "sub section 1.1": "The major sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases. CO2 is the largest contributor, accounting for approximately 76% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. Methane contributes about 16% of emissions, showing significant increases since 2007. Nitrous oxide, which is emitted from agricultural activities and combustion, contributes around 6.2%. Fluorinated gases, though less significant at about 2%, are still notable as they are emitted from various industrial processes. The sectors most responsible for these emissions are energy, industry, transport, and buildings."

  {
    "sub section 1.2": "Human activities significantly influence climate change, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2, CH4, and N2O. Since the mid-20th century, it has been extremely likely that these activities have been the dominant cause of observed global warming. Key impacts include warming of the atmosphere and oceans, altered precipitation patterns, significant reductions in snow and ice, and rising sea levels. Moreover, there has been an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events, with heatwaves and heavy precipitation becoming more common. This overwhelming body of evidence indicates that human influences are the primary drivers of current climate change."
  },
  {
    "sub section 2.1": "Recent trends indicate that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have changed significantly since about 1950, often correlating with human influence. For instance, there has been a notable increase in warm temperature extremes and a decrease in cold extremes globally. Heatwaves have likely doubled in occurrence in regions such as Europe and Australia. Additionally, heavy precipitation events have increased, particularly in North America and Europe, leading to heightened flooding risks. While there is low confidence in global trends regarding droughts and tropical cyclones, the evidence of more intense weather events overall suggests serious implications for human health and infrastructure."

  {
    "sub section 3.1": "The impacts of climate change on ecosystems and human systems are substantial. Ecologically, climate change has caused significant shifts in species distribution and has been linked to species extinctions. Increased disturbances such as droughts and windstorms have become more frequent, impacting both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Ocean ecosystems, particularly coral reefs, are highly vulnerable, experiencing bleaching and habitat loss due to rising temperatures and acidification. On a societal level, climate change adversely affects agricultural productivity, with staple crops suffering declines and heightened food insecurity being increasingly recognized."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.1": "Ocean acidification is evidenced by a measurable decrease in ocean surface water pH, corresponding to a 26% increase in acidity since the industrial era began. This phenomenon negatively affects marine organisms, leading to thinner shells in species such as pteropods and declining coral growth rates, which in turn threatens marine biodiversity and ecosystems."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.2": "Observable trends in global temperatures clearly demonstrate a warming pattern. Most of the globe has experienced significant temperature increases since the mid-20th century. The rate of warming over the last three decades has been higher than in previous decades, with notable impacts on weather extremes and ecological balance. Each of the last three decades has been the warmest on record since 1850."

  {
    "sub section 4.3": "Recent evidence confirms significant ice melting from polar regions. The Greenland ice sheet has seen a marked increase in mass loss from 1992 to 2011, with even greater losses recorded in recent years. In Antarctica, the rates of ice mass loss have also increased, affecting sea levels globally. Arctic sea ice extent has consistently declined, especially in terms of summer minimums."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.4": "Ocean temperatures have significantly increased, especially in the upper layers, showing an approximate warming of 0.11 Â°C per decade from 1971 to 2010. This warming trend contributes to over 90% of the heat accumulated in the climate system, impacting marine ecosystems and climate feedback mechanisms."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.5": "Globally, precipitation patterns have changed since 1951, with an increase in heavy precipitation events linked to climate change. While there is low confidence regarding global trends for droughts, certain regions have seen increased rainfall alongside associated flood risks, necessitating ongoing assessments of water resources."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.6": "Projections indicate that sea levels are rising at an increasing rate, primarily due to glacier mass loss and thermal expansion of ocean waters. Mean sea level rose approximately 1.7 mm per year from 1901 to 2010, accelerating to about 3.2 mm annually from 1993 to 2010. This trend suggests serious implications for coastal populations and ecosystems as climate change progresses."
