    "sub section 1.1": "The primary sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are predominantly from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, accounting for about 78% of the total emission increase between 1970 and 2010. In 2010, CO2 emissions from these sources reached approximately 32 GtCO2 per year and have continued to grow, with global GHG emissions peaking at 49 GtCO2-equivalent in 2010. The sectors contributing most include energy, industry, transport, and buildings. Methane and nitrous oxide also play significant roles, with CO2 being the largest contributor to radiative forcing. Current trends show rising atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O, indicating that population growth, economic development, and energy consumption patterns continue to drive emissions. Without substantial reductions, we risk exceeding critical temperature thresholds, leading to severe climatic impacts."

    "sub section 1.2": "Human activities significantly influence climate change primarily through the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. The U.N. emphasizes that since the mid-20th century, human activities have become the dominant cause of observed warming. GHG emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation for agriculture, and industrial processes substantially increase atmospheric CO2 levels, which contribute to global temperature increases. Extreme weather events like heat waves are linked to these emissions. Future projections suggest that without mitigation, global temperatures could rise by 1.5 to 2°C by 2100, severely impacting ecosystems and human health across the globe."
  },
  {
    "sub section 2.1": "Recent evaluations indicate significant increases in extreme weather events linked to climate change. The frequency of heat waves has increased by over 50% in regions, with human influence more than doubling their occurrence probability. In North America, heavy precipitation events have risen by about 20% since 2000. High sea levels and their occurrence have also increased, threatening coastal areas. The number of cold temperature extremes has notably decreased, while the impacts of heat waves on human health have become increasingly severe, underscoring the direction of climate change's influence on weather patterns."

  {
    "sub section 3.1": "Climate change's ecological and socio-economic impacts are significant and far-reaching. Biodiversity is at risk, with projections suggesting up to 1 million species could face extinction due to changing habitats. Socio-economically, climate change leads to greater mortality and morbidity and initializes extensive economic losses—weather-related disasters have increased over 200% in costs in the last 30 years. The disadvantaged often bear the brunt of impacts, exacerbating existing inequalities. As temperatures continue to rise, the risks to food security, health, and economic stability will intensify unless action is taken to mitigate these effects."

  {
    "sub section 4.1": "Ocean acidification has escalated due to the absorption of atmospheric CO2, leading to a decrease in pH levels from historical averages of around 8.2 to current levels near 8.1, representing a 26% increase in acidity. Projections suggest pH could drop to 7.8-7.9 by 2100 under high emissions scenarios. This acidification affects marine life, particularly calcifying organisms like corals, whose health is crucial for maintaining marine biodiversity."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.2": "Observed climate change trends illustrate a 1.2°C increase in global average temperatures since the late 19th century, with significant changes in precipitation patterns, including a 5-10% increase in mid-latitude regions since 1901. Extreme weather events have also increased, with human activities driving these changes through greenhouse gas emissions that exceed pre-industrial levels."

  {
    "sub section 4.3": "In polar regions, ice melting has accelerated, with Greenland losing approximately 3,800 billion tons of ice between 1992 and 2018. The Arctic sees a decline of 3.5 to 4.1% in annual mean sea ice extent per decade, with summer minimums declining even faster. These changes pose profound risks, contributing to rising sea levels and habitat loss for polar species."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.4": "Ocean warming has risen approximately 0.11°C per decade and is linked to shifts in species distribution and composition. Coral reef bleaching events have become more frequent, affecting biodiversity and altering marine food webs. The expansion of oxygen minimum zones has also been observed, negatively impacting fish habitats and marine ecosystems."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.5": "Precipitation patterns are altering, with some regions experiencing increases of up to 10-20% in rainfall while others experience declines. Increased salinity trends indicate regions of higher evaporation are becoming more saline, while regions with increases in precipitation are showing freshwater influxes."
  },
  {
    "sub section 4.6": "Global sea level rise projections indicate an increase of 0.3 to 0.6 meters by 2050 and potentially up to 2 meters by 2100, driven by thermal expansion and ice mass loss. Coastal communities are at risk of severe flooding and habitat loss, necessitating urgent adaptation and mitigation strategies to confront these challenges."
