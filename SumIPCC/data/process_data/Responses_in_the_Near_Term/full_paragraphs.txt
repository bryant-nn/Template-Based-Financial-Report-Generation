Long-Term Interactions Between Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable Development  Mitigation and adaptation can lead to synergies and trade-offs with sustainable development. Accelerated and equitable mitigation and adaptation bring benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and are critical to achieving sustainable development. Climate resilient development 138 pathways are progressively constrained by every increment of further warming. There is a rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.
Advancing Integrated Climate Action for Sustainable  Development An inclusive, equitable approach to integrating adaptation, mitigation and development can advance sustainable development in the long term. Integrated responses can harness synergies for sustainable development and reduce trade-offs. Shifting development pathways towards sustainability and advancing climate resilient development is enabled when governments, civil society and the private sector make development choices that prioritise risk reduction, equity and justice, and when decision-making processes, finance and actions are integrated across governance levels, sectors and timeframes. Inclusive processes involving local knowledge and Indigenous Knowledge increase these prospects. However, opportunities for action differ substantially among and within regions, driven by historical and ongoing patterns of development. Accelerated financial support for developing countries is critical to enhance mitigation and adaptation action.  Policies that shift development pathways towards sustainability can broaden the portfolio of available mitigation and adaptation responses. Combining mitigation with action to shift development pathways, such as broader sectoral policies, approaches that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, financial regulation, or macroeconomic policies can overcome barriers and open up a broader range of mitigation options. Integrated, inclusive planning and investment in everyday decisionmaking about urban infrastructure can significantly increase the adaptive capacity of urban and rural settlements. Coastal cities and settlements play an important role in advancing climate resilient development due to the high number of people living in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone, the escalating and climate compounded risk that they face, and their vital role in national economies and beyond .  Observed adverse impacts and related losses and damages, projected risks, trends in vulnerability, and adaptation limits demonstrate that transformation for sustainability and climate resilient development action is more urgent than previously assessed. Climate resilient development integrates adaptation and GHG mitigation to advance sustainable development for all. Climate resilient development pathways have been constrained by past development, emissions and climate change and are progressively constrained by every increment of warming, in particular beyond 1.5°C. Climate resilient development will not be possible in some regions and sub-regions if global warming exceeds 2°C. Safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystems is fundamental to climate resilient development, but biodiversity and ecosystem services have limited capacity to adapt to increasing global warming levels, making climate resilient development progressively harder to achieve beyond 1.5°C warming.  The cumulative scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human well-being and planetary health . Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. Opportunities for near-term action are assessed in the following section.
The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .  
Benefits of Strengthening Near-Term Action  Accelerated implementation of adaptation will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations. Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions would reduce future adaptation costs and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, avoid locking-in emission sources, and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes. These near-term actions involve higher up-front investments and disruptive changes, which can be moderated by a range of enabling conditions and removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility. Accelerated implementation of adaptation responses will bring benefits to human well-being. As adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term planning and accelerated implementation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that constraints remain for some regions. The benefits to vulnerable populations would be high .  Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, compared to higher warming levels, but cannot eliminate them all . The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming. Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming which will decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and many water-related options, as well as increasing mitigation feasibility risks, such as for options based on ecosystems. Comprehensive, effective, and innovative responses integrating adaptation and mitigation can harness synergies and reduce trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, as well as in meeting requirements for financing .  Mitigation actions will have other sustainable development co-benefits. Mitigation will improve air quality and human health in the near term notably because many air pollutants are co-emitted by GHG emitting sectors and because methane emissions leads to surface ozone formation. The benefits from air quality improvement include prevention of air pollution-related premature deaths, chronic diseases and damages to ecosystems and crops. The economic benefits for human health from air quality improvement arising from mitigation action can be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially even larger . As methane has a short lifetime but is a potent GHG, strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit near-term warming and improve air quality by reducing global surface ozone.  Challenges from delayed adaptation and mitigation actions include the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. The continued installation of unabated fossil fuel infrastructure will ‘lock-in’ GHG emissions. Limiting global warming to 2°C or below will leave a substantial amount of fossil fuels unburned and could strand considerable fossil fuel infrastructure , with globally discounted value projected to be around USD 1 to 4 trillion from 2015 to 2050. Early actions would limit the size of these stranded assets, whereas delayed actions with continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would raise future stranded assets to the higher end of the range – thereby acting as barriers and increasing political economy feasibility risks that may jeopardise efforts to limit global warming. .  Scaling-up near-term climate actions will mobilise a mix of low-cost and high-cost options. High-cost options, as in energy and infrastructure, are needed to avoid future lock-ins, foster innovation and initiate transformational changes. Climate resilient development pathways in support of sustainable development for all are shaped by equity, and social and climate justice. Embedding effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation in development planning can reduce vulnerability, conserve and restore ecosystems, and enable climate resilient development. This is especially challenging in localities with persistent development gaps and limited resources.  Scaling-up climate action may generate disruptive changes in economic structure with distributional consequences and need to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, within and between countries. Deeper fiscal, financial, institutional and regulatory reforms can offset such adverse effects and unlock mitigation potentials. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade will determine the extent to which medium and long-term development pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development outcomes.  Enabling conditions would need to be strengthened in the nearterm and barriers reduced or removed to realise opportunities for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions and climate resilient development. These enabling conditions are differentiated by national, regional and local circumstances and geographies, according to capabilities, and include: equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid and far-reaching transitions in sectors and system , measures to achieve synergies and reduce tradeoffs with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, improved international cooperation and technology improvements, and integration of near-term actions across sectors, systems and regions.  Barriers to feasibility would need to be reduced or removed to deploy mitigation and adaptation options at scale. Many limits to feasibility and effectiveness of responses can be overcome by addressing a range of barriers, including economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical barriers. The feasibility and effectiveness of options increase with integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that differentiate responses based on climate risk, cut across systems and address social inequities. Strengthened near-term actions in modelled cost-effective pathways that limit global warming to 2°C or lower, reduce the overall risk to the feasibility of the system transitions, compared to modelled pathways with delayed or uncoordinated action.  Integrating ambitious climate actions with macroeconomic policies under global uncertainty would provide benefits . This encompasses three main directions: economy-wide mainstreaming packages supporting options to improved sustainable low-emission economic recovery, development and job creation programs  safety nets and social protection in the transition; and broadened access to finance, technology and capacity-building and coordinated support to low-emission infrastructure , especially in developing regions, and under debt stress .
Equity and Inclusion in Climate Change Action  Actions that prioritise equity, climate justice, social justice and inclusion lead to more sustainable outcomes, co-benefits, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development. Adaptation responses are immediately needed to reduce rising climate risks, especially for the most vulnerable. Equity, inclusion and just transitions are key to progress on adaptation and deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation. Adaptation and mitigation actions, across scales, sectors and regions, that prioritise equity, climate justice, rights-based approaches, social justice and inclusivity, lead to more sustainable outcomes, reduce trade-offs, support transformative change and advance climate resilient development . Redistributive policies across sectors and regions that shield the poor and vulnerable, social safety nets, equity, inclusion and just transitions, at all scales can enable deeper societal ambitions and resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals., particularly education, hunger, poverty, gender and energy access . Mitigation efforts embedded within the wider development context can increase the pace, depth and breadth of emission reductions . Equity, inclusion and just transitions at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly. The complexity in risk of rising food prices, reduced household incomes, and health and climate-related malnutrition  and mortality increases with little or low levels of adaptation.  Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards. Adaptation outcomes for the most vulnerable within and across countries and regions are enhanced through approaches focusing on equity, inclusivity, and rights-based approaches, including 3.3 to 3.6 billion people living in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods  . Several risks can be moderated with adaptation. The largest adaptation gaps exist among lower income population groups and adaptation progress is unevenly distributed with observed adaptation gaps. Present development challenges causing high vulnerability are influenced by historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Vulnerability is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  Meaningful participation and inclusive planning, informed by cultural values, Indigenous Knowledge, local knowledge, and scientific knowledge can help address adaptation gaps and avoid maladaptation. Such actions with flexible pathways may encourage low-regret and timely actions . Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programmes, including cash transfers and public works programmes, would increase resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure.  Equity, inclusion, just transitions, broad and meaningful participation of all relevant actors in decision making at all scales enable deeper societal ambitions for accelerated mitigation, and climate action more broadly, and build social trust, support transformative changes and an equitable sharing of benefits and burdens. Equity remains a central element in the UN climate regime, notwithstanding shifts in differentiation between states over time and challenges in assessing fair shares. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with significant distributional consequences, within and between countries, including shifting of income and employment during the transition from high to low emissions activities. While some jobs may be lost, low-emissions development can also open up opportunities to enhance skills and create jobs. Broadening equitable access to finance, technologies and governance that facilitate mitigation, and consideration of climate justice can help equitable sharing of benefits and burdens, especially for vulnerable countries and communities.  Development priorities among countries also reflect different starting points and contexts, and enabling conditions for shifting development pathways towards increased sustainability will therefore differ, giving rise to different needs . Implementing just transition principles through collective and participatory decision-making processes is an effective way of integrating equity principles into policies at all scales depending on national circumstances, while in several countries just transition commissions, task forces and national policies have been established .  Many economic and regulatory instruments have been effective in reducing emissions and practical experience has informed instrument design to improve them while addressing distributional goals and social acceptance. The design of behavioural interventions, including the way that choices are presented to consumers work synergistically with price signals, making the combination more effective. Individuals with high socio-economic status contribute disproportionately to emissions, and have the highest potential for emissions reductions, e.g., as citizens, investors, consumers, role models, and professionals . There are options on design of instruments such as taxes, subsidies, prices, and consumption-based approaches, complemented by regulatory instruments to reduce high-emissions consumption while improving equity and societal well-being. Behaviour and lifestyle changes to help end-users adopt low-GHG-intensive options can be supported by policies, infrastructure and technology with multiple co-benefits for societal well-being. Broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, technologies and capacity can also act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways in low-income contexts . Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards to all in these regions in the context of achieving sustainable development objectives, in the near term, can be achieved without significant global emissions growth. Technology development, transfer, capacity building and financing can support developing countries/ regions leapfrogging or transitioning to low-emissions transport systems thereby providing multiple co-benefits . Climate resilient development is advanced when actors work in equitable, just and enabling ways to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, toward equitable and just outcomes .
Near-Term Mitigation and Adaptation Actions  Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. These system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options. Feasible, effective and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available, with differences across systems and regions.  Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. System transitions consistent with pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are more rapid and pronounced in the near-term than in those that limit warming to 2°C . Such a systemic change is unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed. The system transitions make possible the transformative adaptation required for high levels of human health and well-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health, and planetary health.  Feasible, effective and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available. Mitigation options costing USD 100 tCO 2-eq–1 or less could reduce global GHG emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030  . The availability, feasibility 152 and potential of mitigation or effectiveness of adaptation options in the near term differ across systems and regions.  Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. Demand-side mitigation encompasses changes in infrastructure use, end-use technology adoption, and socio-cultural and behavioural change. .
Governance and Policy for Near-Term Climate Change Action  Effective climate action requires political commitment, well-aligned multi-level governance and institutional frameworks, laws, policies and strategies. It needs clear goals, adequate finance and financing tools, coordination across multiple policy domains, and inclusive governance processes. Many mitigation and adaptation policy instruments have been deployed successfully, and could support deep emissions reductions and climate resilience if scaled up and applied widely, depending on national circumstances. Adaptation and mitigation action benefits from drawing on diverse knowledge. Effective climate governance enables mitigation and adaptation by providing overall direction based on national circumstances, setting targets and priorities, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances monitoring and evaluation and regulatory certainty, prioritising inclusive, transparent and equitable decision-making, and improves access to finance and technology. These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws and plans, which are growing in number across sectors and regions, advancing mitigation outcomes and adaptation benefits . Climate laws have been growing in number and have helped deliver mitigation and adaptation outcomes .  Effective municipal, national and sub-national climate institutions, such as expert and co-ordinating bodies, enable co-produced, multi-scale decision-processes, build consensus for action among diverse interests, and inform strategy settings . This requires adequate institutional capacity at all levels. Vulnerabilities and climate risks are often reduced through carefully designed and implemented laws, policies, participatory processes, and interventions that address context specific inequities such as based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income. Policy support is influenced by Indigenous Peoples, businesses, and actors in civil society, including, youth, labour, media, and local communities, and effectiveness is enhanced by partnerships between many different groups in society . Climate-related litigation is growing, with a large number of cases in some developed countries and with a much smaller number in some developing countries, and in some cases has influenced the outcome and ambition of climate governance.  Effective climate governance is enabled by inclusive decision processes, allocation of appropriate resources, and institutional review, monitoring and evaluation. Multi-level, hybrid and cross-sector governance facilitates appropriate consideration for co-benefits and trade-offs, particularly in land sectors where decision processes range from farm level to national scale. Consideration of climate justice can help to facilitate shifting development pathways towards sustainability.  Drawing on diverse knowledge and partnerships, including with women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and ethnic minorities can facilitate climate resilient development and has allowed locally appropriate and socially acceptable solutions.  Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully. These instruments could support deep emissions reductions if scaled up and applied more widely. Practical experience has informed instrument design and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, and equity.  Scaling up and enhancing the use of regulatory instruments, consistent with national circumstances, can improve mitigation outcomes in sectoral applications, and regulatory instruments that include flexibility mechanisms can reduce costs of cutting emissions.  Where implemented, carbon pricing instruments have incentivized low-cost emissions reduction measures, but have been less effective, on their own and at prevailing prices during the assessment period, to promote higher-cost measures necessary for further reductions. Revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading can be used for equity and distributional goals, for example to support low-income households, among other approaches. There is no consistent evidence that current emission trading systems have led to significant emissions leakage.  Removing fossil fuel subsidies would reduce emissions, improve public revenue and macroeconomic performance, and yield other environmental and sustainable development benefits such as improved public revenue, macroeconomic and sustainability performance; subsidy removal can have adverse distributional impacts especially on the most economically vulnerable groups which, in some cases, can be mitigated by measures such as re-distributing revenue saved, and depend on national circumstances. Fossil fuel subsidy removal is projected by various studies to reduce global CO 2 emissions by 1–4%, and GHG emissions by up to 10% by 2030, varying across regions .  National policies to support technology development, and participation in international markets for emission reduction, can bring positive spillover effects for other countries , although reduced demand for fossil fuels as a result of climate policy could result in costs to exporting countries . Economy-wide packages can meet short-term economic goals while reducing emissions and shifting development pathways towards sustainability. Examples are public spending commitments; pricing reforms; and investment in education and training, R&D and infrastructure. Effective policy packages would be comprehensive in coverage, harnessed to a clear vision for change, balanced across objectives, aligned with specific technology and system needs, consistent in terms of design and tailored to national circumstances .
Strengthening the Response: Finance, International Cooperation and Technology  Finance, international cooperation and technology are critical enablers for accelerated climate action. If climate goals are to be achieved, both adaptation and mitigation financing would have to increase many-fold. There is sufficient global capital to close the global investment gaps but there are barriers to redirect capital to climate action. Barriers include institutional, regulatory and market access barriers, which can be reduced to address the needs and opportunities, economic vulnerability and indebtedness in many developing countries. Enhancing international cooperation is possible through multiple channels. Enhancing technology innovation systems is key to accelerate the widespread adoption of technologies and practices.
The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible  Change The likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts increase with higher global warming levels. As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems such as forests , coral reefs and in Arctic regions . Risks associated with large-scale singular events or tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from tropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5°C to 2.5°C  and to very high risk between 2.5°C to 4°C. The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations can be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century time scales. The probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds increases with further warming.  Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years . Global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st century, with projected regional relative sea level rise within 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline . The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100. At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia. The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global surface temperatures. Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C . Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate periods: global mean sea level was very likely 5 to 25 m higher than today roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C to 4°C higher than 1850–1900. Further examples of unavoidable changes in the climate system due to multi-decadal or longer response timescales include continued glacier melt  and permafrost carbon loss.  The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global warming levels. Warming substantially above the assessed very likely range for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and there is high confidence this would lead to regional changes greater than assessed in many aspects of the climate system. Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes could occur at regional scales even for global warming within the very likely assessed range for a given GHG emissions scenario. Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions scenario  – cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes 123 and would have severe impacts on populations in low elevation coastal zones. If global warming increases, some compound extreme events 124 will become more frequent, with higher likelihood of unprecedented intensities, durations or spatial extent. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all considered scenarios, however an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100 . If such a low probability event were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. A sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions within decades, as have occurred in the past, is a low-likelihood high-impact event that would lead to substantial cooling globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades.
Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors. Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access.  Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR 136. In global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand. Such pathways meet energy service demand with relatively low energy use, through e.g., enhanced energy efficiency and behavioural changes and increased electrification of energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot generally implement such changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C.  AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs may result from the impacts of climate change, competing demands on land, conflicts with food security and livelihoods, the complexity of land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 include land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management.  In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, CDR can fulfil three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions  to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO 2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions. CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. Specifically, maturity ranges from lower maturity to higher maturity; removal and storage potential ranges from lower potential to higher potential; costs range from lower cost to higher cost  . Estimated storage timescales vary from decades to centuries for methods that store carbon in vegetation and through soil carbon management, to ten thousand years or more for methods that store carbon in geological formations . Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry and soil carbon sequestration are currently the only widely practiced CDR methods. Methods and levels of CDR deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary depending on assumptions about costs, availability and constraints.
Synergies and trade-offs, costs and benefits  Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable development . Synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude of changes and the development context including inequalities, with consideration of climate justice. The potential or effectiveness of some adaptation and mitigation options decreases as climate change intensifies .  In the energy sector, transitions to low-emission systems will have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency and renewable energy.  For agriculture, land, and food systems, many land management options and demand-side response options  can contribute to eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and well-being, clean water and sanitation, and life on land . In contrast, certain adaptation options that promote intensification of production, such as irrigation, may have negative effects on sustainability  .  Reforestation, improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management are examples of CDR methods that can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods, depending on context . However, afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or biochar can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land tenure is insecure.  Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or shift global development towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity, and have the most pronounced synergies with respect to sustainable development .  Strengthening climate change mitigation action entails more rapid transitions and higher up-front investments, but brings benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and reduced adaptation costs. The aggregate effects of climate change mitigation on global GDP  are small compared to global projected GDP growth. Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages and the costs of adaptation generally increase with global warming level.  Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all damages from climate change, including non-monetary damages, or to capture the heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic damages. Even without accounting for these factors or for the co-benefits of mitigation, the global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation . This finding is robust against a wide range of assumptions about social preferences on inequalities and discounting over time . Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks and reduced adaptation needs 140.  Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the potentially strong economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement, may enhance the estimated benefits of mitigation . The economic effects of strengthened mitigation action vary across regions and countries, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with implications for near-term actions, equity , sustainability, and finance .
Near-Term Risks  Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term with increasing global warming. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in increased compounding and cascading impacts becoming more difficult to manage. Losses and damages will increase with increasing global warming, while strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns would increase exposure and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards. Global warming will continue to increase in the near term mainly due to increased cumulative CO 2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards , increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. In the near term, natural variability will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI. The occurrence of individual years with global surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near term 150, it would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years.  The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic development and adaptation. In the near term, many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios . Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure . Urbanisation increases hot extremes  and precipitation runoff intensity. Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks. Vulnerability will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise . Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Vulnerability to climate change for ecosystems will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of human development, including from unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and management of land, ocean, and water. Several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation.  Principal hazards and associated risks expected in the near term are: • Increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes and dangerous heat-humidity conditions, with increased human mortality, morbidity, and labour productivity loss.  • Increasing frequency of marine heatwaves will increase risks of biodiversity loss in the oceans, including from mass mortality events.  • Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in forest ecosystems and kelp and seagrass ecosystems and are high to very high in Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems and warm-water coral reefs.  • More intense and frequent extreme rainfall and associated flooding in many regions including coastal and other low-lying cities , and increased proportion of and peak wind speeds of intense tropical cyclones.  • High risks from dryland water scarcity, wildfire damage, and permafrost degradation.  • Continued sea level rise and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events encroaching on coastal human settlements and damaging coastal infrastructure , committing low-lying coastal ecosystems to submergence and loss, expanding land salinization, with cascading to risks to livelihoods, health, well-being, cultural values, food and water security.  • Climate change will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near to long term. Further warming will increase climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks, and mental health challenges including anxiety and stress.  Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, and water availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in most mountain regions .  • The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation will increase rain-generated local flooding.  Multiple climate change risks will increasingly compound and cascade in the near term. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming including concurrent heatwaves and drought. Risks to health and food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by heatinduced labour productivity losses. These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions . Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to food systems, human settlements, infrastructure and health will make these risks more severe and more difficult to manage, including when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics . Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs. Increasing transboundary risks are projected across the food, energy and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows and may interact with impacts from other crises such as pandemics. Risks also arise from some responses intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures, such as afforestation of naturally unforested land or poorly implemented bioenergy compounding climate-related risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods.  With every increment of global warming losses and damages will increase, become increasingly difficult to avoid and be strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages will be unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. .
Observed Climate System Changes and Impacts to  Date It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred . The scale of recent changes across the climate system as a whole and the present state of many aspects of the climate system are unprecedented over many centuries to many thousands of years. It is very likely that GHG emissions were the main driver of tropospheric warming and extremely likely that human-caused stratospheric ozone depletion was the main driver of stratospheric cooling between 1979 and the mid-1990s. It is virtually certain that the global upper ocean has warmed since the 1970s and extremely likely that human influence is the main driver. Ocean warming accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system, with land warming, ice loss and atmospheric warming accounting for about 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively. Global mean sea level increased by 0.20 [0.15 to 0.25] m between 1901 and 2018. The average rate of sea level rise was 1.3 [0.6 to 2.1]mm yr-1 between 1901 and 1971, increasing to 1.9 [0.8 to 2.9] mm yr-1 between 1971 and 2006, and further increasing to 3.7 [3.2 to –4.2] mm yr -1 between 2006 and 2018. Human influence was very likely the main driver of these increases since at least 1971. Human influence is very likely the main driver of the global retreat of glaciers since the 1990s and the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979–1988 and 2010–2019. Human influence has also very likely contributed to decreased Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover and surface melting of the Greenland ice sheet. It is virtually certain that human-caused CO2 emissions are the main driver of current global acidification of the surface open ocean.  Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. Evidence of observed changes in extremes such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation, droughts, and tropical cyclones, and, in particular, their attribution to human influence, has strengthened since AR5. It is virtually certain that hot extremes have become more frequent and more intense across most land regions since the 1950s, while cold extremes have become less frequent and less severe, with high confidence that human-caused climate change is the main driver of these changes. Marine heatwaves have approximately doubled in frequency since the 1980s, and human influence has very likely contributed to most of them since at least 2006. The frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend analysis, and human-caused climate change is likely the main driver. Human-caused climate change has contributed to increases in agricultural and ecological droughts in some regions due to increased land evapotranspiration . It is likely that the global proportion of major tropical cyclone occurrence has increased over the last four decades.  Climate change has caused substantial damages, and increasingly irreversible losses, in terrestrial, freshwater, cryospheric and coastal and open ocean ecosystems. The extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger than estimated in previous assessments. Approximately half of the species assessed globally have shifted polewards or, on land, also to higher elevations. Biological responses including changes in geographic placement and shifting seasonal timing are often not sufficient to cope with recent climate change. Hundreds of local losses of species have been driven by increases in the magnitude of heat extremes and mass mortality events on land and in the ocean. Impacts on some ecosystems are approaching irreversibility such as the impacts of hydrological changes resulting from the retreat of glaciers, or the changes in some mountain and Arctic ecosystems driven by permafrost thaw. Impacts in ecosystems from slow-onset processes such as ocean acidification, sea level rise or regional decreases in precipitation have also been attributed to human-caused climate change. Climate change has contributed to desertification and exacerbated land degradation, particularly in low lying coastal areas, river deltas, drylands and in permafrost areas. Nearly 50% of coastal wetlands have been lost over the last 100 years, as a result of the combined effects of localised human pressures, sea level rise, warming and extreme climate events.  Climate change has reduced food security and affected water security due to warming, changing precipitation patterns, reduction and loss of cryospheric elements, and greater frequency and intensity of climatic extremes, thereby hindering efforts to meet Sustainable Development Goals. Although overall agricultural productivity has increased, climate change has slowed this growth in agricultural productivity over the past 50 years globally , with related negative crop yield impacts mainly recorded in mid- and low latitude regions, and some positive impacts in some high latitude regions. Ocean warming in the 20th century and beyond has contributed to an overall decrease in maximum catch potential, compounding the impacts from overfishing for some fish stocks. Ocean warming and ocean acidification have adversely affected food production from shellfish aquaculture and fisheries in some oceanic regions . Current levels of global warming are associated with moderate risks from increased dryland water scarcity. Roughly half of the world’s population currently experiences severe water scarcity for at least some part of the year due to a combination of climatic and non-climatic drivers. Unsustainable agricultural expansion, driven in part by unbalanced diets , increases ecosystem and human vulnerability and leads to competition for land and/or water resources. Increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people to acute food insecurity and reduced water security, with the largest impacts observed in many locations and/or communities in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, LDCs, Small Islands and the Arctic, and for small-scale food producers, low-income households and Indigenous Peoples globally.  In urban settings, climate change has caused adverse impacts on human health, livelihoods and key infrastructure. Hot extremes including heatwaves have intensified in cities , where they have also worsened air pollution events and limited functioning of key infrastructure . Urban infrastructure, including transportation, water, sanitation and energy systems have been compromised by extreme and slow-onset events , with resulting economic losses, disruptions of services and impacts to well-being. Observed impacts are concentrated amongst economically and socially marginalised urban residents, e.g., those living in informal settlements. Cities intensify human-caused warming locally, while urbanisation also increases mean and heavy precipitation over and/or downwind of cities and resulting runoff intensity .  Climate change has adversely affected human physical health globally and mental health in assessed regions, and is contributing to humanitarian crises where climate hazards interact with high vulnerability. In all regions increases in extreme heat events have resulted in human mortality and morbidity . The occurrence of climate-related food-borne and water-borne diseases has increased. The incidence of vector-borne diseases has increased from range expansion and/or increased reproduction of disease vectors. Animal and human diseases, including zoonoses, are emerging in new areas . In assessed regions, some mental health challenges are associated with increasing temperatures, trauma from extreme events, and loss of livelihoods and culture . Climate change impacts on health are mediated through natural and human systems, including economic and social conditions and disruptions. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in Africa, Asia, North America, and Central and South America , with small island states in the Caribbean and South Pacific being disproportionately affected relative to their small population size. Through displacement and involuntary migration from extreme weather and climate events, climate change has generated and perpetuated vulnerability .  Human influence has likely increased the chance of compound extreme events since the 1950s. Concurrent and repeated climate hazards have occurred in all regions, increasing impacts and risks to health, ecosystems, infrastructure, livelihoods and food . Compound extreme events include increases in the frequency of concurrent heatwaves and droughts; fire weather in some regions; and compound flooding in some locations. Multiple risks interact, generating new sources of vulnerability to climate hazards, and compounding overall risk. Compound climate hazards can overwhelm adaptive capacity and substantially increase damage ).  Economic impacts attributable to climate change are increasingly affecting peoples’ livelihoods and are causing economic and societal impacts across national boundaries. Economic damages from climate change have been detected in climate-exposed sectors, with regional effects to agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, and tourism, and through outdoor labour productivity with some exceptions of positive impacts in regions with low energy demand and comparative advantages in agricultural markets and tourism. Individual livelihoods have been affected through changes in agricultural productivity, impacts on human health and food security, destruction of homes and infrastructure, and loss of property and income, with adverse effects on gender and social equity . Tropical cyclones have reduced economic growth in the short-term. Event attribution studies and physical understanding indicate that human-caused climate change increases heavy precipitation associated with tropical cyclones. Wildfires in many regions have affected built assets, economic activity, and health. In cities and settlements, climate impacts to key infrastructure are leading to losses and damages across water and food systems, and affect economic activity, with impacts extending beyond the area directly impacted by the climate hazard.  Climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people . Losses and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors. Cultural losses, related to tangible and intangible heritage, threaten adaptive capacity and may result in irrevocable losses of sense of belonging, valued cultural practices, identity and home, particularly for Indigenous Peoples and those more directly reliant on the environment for subsistence. For example, changes in snow cover, lake and river ice, and permafrost in many Arctic regions, are harming the livelihoods and cultural identity of Arctic residents including Indigenous populations. Infrastructure, including transportation, water, sanitation and energy systems have been compromised by extreme and slow-onset events, with resulting economic losses, disruptions of services and impacts to well-being.  Across sectors and regions, the most vulnerable people and systems have been disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. LDCs and SIDS who have much lower per capita emissions than the global average excluding CO2-LULUCF, also have high vulnerability to climatic hazards, with global hotspots of high human vulnerability observed in West-, Central- and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, SIDS and the Arctic. Regions and people with considerable development constraints have high vulnerability to climatic hazards. Vulnerability is higher in locations with poverty, governance challenges and limited access to basic services and resources, violent conflict and high levels of climate-sensitive livelihoods  . Vulnerability at different spatial levels is exacerbated by inequity and marginalisation linked to gender, ethnicity, low income or combinations thereof, especially for many Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in contexts that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Between 2010 and 2020, human mortality from floods, droughts and storms was 15 times higher in highly vulnerable regions, compared to regions with very low vulnerability. In the Arctic and in some high mountain regions, negative impacts of cryosphere change have been especially felt among Indigenous Peoples. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate change differs substantially among and within regions, driven by patterns of intersecting socio-economic development, unsustainable ocean and land use, inequity, marginalisation, historical and ongoing patterns of inequity such as colonialism, and governance.
Impacts and Related Risks  For a given level of warming, many climate-related risks are assessed to be higher than in AR5. Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern 121 are assessed to become high to very high at lower global warming levels compared to what was assessed in AR5. This is based upon recent evidence of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level of global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to multiple times higher than currently observed for 127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people and species. Risks, including cascading risks and risks from overshoot, are projected to become increasingly severe with every increment of global warming.  Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present but lower than at 2°C . Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C. In terrestrial ecosystems, 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed will likely face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5°C. Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of global warming. At this GWL, many low-elevation and small glaciers around the world would lose most of their mass or disappear within decades to centuries. Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states and Least Developed Countries .  At 2°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal distribution of impacts, global aggregate impacts and large-scale singular events would be transitioning to high , those associated with extreme weather events would be transitioning to very high, and those associated with unique and threatened systems would be very high  . With about 2°C warming, climate-related changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, affecting tens to hundreds of millions of people, particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America. For example, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river basins by up to 20% . Climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure will rise sharply in the mid and long term with further global warming, especially in places already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities .  At global warming of 3°C, additional risks in many sectors and regions reach high or very high levels, implying widespread systemic impacts, irreversible change and many additional adaptation limits . For example, very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is projected to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from 1.5°C to 3°C. Projected increases in direct flood damages are higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2°C and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C, compared to 1.5°C global warming without adaptation.  Global warming of 4°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems. Beyond 4°C of warming, projected impacts on natural systems include local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area. At this level of warming, approximately 10% of the global land area is projected to face both increasing high and decreasing low extreme streamflow, affecting, without additional adaptation, over 2.1 billion people and about 4 billion people are projected to experience water scarcity. At 4°C of warming, the global burned area is projected to increase by 50 to 70% and the fire frequency by ~30% compared to today.  Projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming , but they will also strongly depend on socio-economic development trajectories and adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability and exposure. For example, development pathways with higher demand for food, animal feed, and water, more resource-intensive consumption and production, and limited technological improvements result in higher risks from water scarcity in drylands, land degradation and food insecurity . Changes in, for example, demography or investments in health systems have effect on a variety of health-related outcomes including heat-related morbidity and mortality.  With every increment of warming, climate change impacts and risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming, such as concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding and fire weather. In addition, multiple climatic and non-climatic risk drivers such as biodiversity loss or violent conflict will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and regions. Furthermore, risks can arise from some responses that are intended to reduce the risks of climate change, e.g., adverse side effects of some emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures .  Solar Radiation Modification approaches, if they were to be implemented, introduce a widespread range of new risks to people and ecosystems, which are not well understood. SRM has the potential to offset warming within one or two decades and ameliorate some climate hazards but would not restore climate to a previous state, and substantial residual or overcompensating climate change would occur at regional and seasonal scales. Effects of SRM would depend on the specific approach used 122, and a sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO 2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change. SRM would not stop atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from increasing nor reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions. Large uncertainties and knowledge gaps are associated with the potential of SRM approaches to reduce climate change risks. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance poses risks as deployment by a limited number of states could create international tensions.
Long-term Adaptation Options and Limits  With increasing warming, adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective. At higher levels of warming, losses and damages will increase, and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. Maladaptation can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks but can be avoided by long-term planning and the implementation of adaptation actions that are flexible, multi-sectoral and inclusive. The effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions and will decrease with increasing warming 125 . For example, common adaptation responses in agriculture – adopting improved cultivars and agronomic practices, and changes in cropping patterns and crop systems – will become less effective from 2°C to higher levels of warming. The effectiveness of most water-related adaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing warming. Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming . Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing global warming. Globally, adaptation options related to agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C, with a substantial increase in residual risk.  With increasing global warming, more limits to adaptation will be reached and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations, will increase. Already below 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation responses by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will increasingly face hard limits. Above 1.5°C, some ecosystem-based adaptation measures will lose their effectiveness in providing benefits to people as these ecosystems will reach hard adaptation limits. Adaptation to address the risks of heat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work for humans face soft and hard limits across regions that become significantly more severe at 1.5°C, and are particularly relevant for regions with warm climates. Above 1.5°C global warming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt . By 2°C, soft limits are projected for multiple staple crops, particularly in tropical regions. By 3°C, soft limits are projected for some water management measures for many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe .  Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. For example, inclusive, integrated and long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national scales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems and financial and technological resources and capabilities foster urban and rural system transition. There are a range of cross-cutting adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing that have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater benefits to other adaptation options when combined. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation, and addressing a range of constraints, primarily in the financial, governance, institutional and policy domains, can help overcome soft adaptation limits. However, adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits.  Maladaptive responses to climate change can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing inequalities. Actions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation. Adaptation options can become maladaptive due to their environmental impacts that constrain ecosystem services and decrease biodiversity and ecosystem resilience to climate change or by causing adverse outcomes for different groups, exacerbating inequity. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive and long-term planning and implementation of adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems.  Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge as it implies both dealing with slow onset changes and increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events . Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise. Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes. Ecosystem-based solutions such as wetlands provide co-benefits for the environment and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for flood defences , but have site-specific physical limits, at least above 1.5ºC of global warming and lose effectiveness at high rates of sea level rise beyond 0.5 to 1 cm yr -1. Seawalls can be maladaptive as they effectively reduce impacts in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan.
Remaining Carbon Budgets  Limiting global temperature increase to a specific level requires limiting cumulative net CO2 emissions to within a finite carbon budget , along with strong reductions in other GHGs. For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises by likely 0.27°C to 0.63°C. This relationship implies that there is a finite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in order to limit warming to any given level.  The best estimates of the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C this is 1150 GtCO2.128 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantified based on the assessed value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of historical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from thawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions reach net zero, as well as variations in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions due in part to mitigation action. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given RCB or the larger RCB for the same level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to 600 GtCO 2 depending on non-CO 2 warming 129 . Limiting warming to 2°C with a 67% likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 GtCO2 from the beginning of 2020. To stay below 2°C with a 50% likelihood, the RCB is higher, i.e., 1350 GtCO 2 If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C, and exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C . Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about four-fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and to about two-thirds of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C.  In scenarios with increasing CO 2 emissions, the land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. While natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute terms, a progressively larger amount of CO 2 under higher compared to lower CO2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, that is, the proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decreases with increasing cumulative net CO2 emissions. Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, such as GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere . In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations  and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low GHG emissions scenario 133.
Land, Ocean, Food, and Water  There is substantial mitigation and adaptation potential from options in agriculture, forestry and other land use, and in the oceans, that could be upscaled in the near term across most regions. Conservation, improved management, and restoration of forests and other ecosystems offer the largest share of economic mitigation potential, with reduced deforestation in tropical regions having the highest total mitigation potential. Ecosystem restoration, reforestation, and afforestation can lead to trade-offs due to competing demands on land. Minimizing trade-offs requires integrated approaches to meet multiple objectives including food security. Demand-side measures  and sustainable agricultural intensification can reduce ecosystem conversion and CH4 and N2 O emissions, and free up land for reforestation and ecosystem restoration. Sustainably sourced agriculture and forest products, including long-lived wood products, can be used instead of more GHG-intensive products in other sectors. Effective adaptation options include cultivar improvements, agroforestry, community-based adaptation, farm and landscape diversification, and urban agriculture. These AFOLU response options require integration of biophysical, socioeconomic and other enabling factors. The effectiveness of ecosystem-based adaptation and most water-related adaptation options declines with increasing warming.  Some options, such as conservation of high-carbon ecosystems , have immediate impacts while others, such as restoration of high-carbon ecosystems, reclamation of degraded soils or afforestation, take decades to deliver measurable results. Many sustainable land management technologies and practices are financially profitable in three to ten years.  Maintaining the resilience of biodiversity and ecosystem services at a global scale depends on effective and equitable conservation of approximately 30–50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and ocean areas, including currently near-natural ecosystems. The services and options provided by terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems can be supported by protection, restoration, precautionary ecosystem-based management of renewable resource use, and the reduction of pollution and other stressors.  Large-scale land conversion for bioenergy, biochar, or afforestation can increase risks to biodiversity, water and food security. In contrast, restoring natural forests and drained peatlands, and improving sustainability of managed forests enhances the resilience of carbon stocks and sinks and reduces ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. Cooperation, and inclusive decision making, with local communities and Indigenous Peoples, as well as recognition of inherent rights of Indigenous Peoples, is integral to successful adaptation across forests and other ecosystems.  Natural rivers, wetlands and upstream forests reduce flood risk in most circumstances. Enhancing natural water retention such as by restoring wetlands and rivers, land use planning such as no build zones or upstream forest management, can further reduce flood risk . For inland flooding, combinations of non-structural measures like early warning systems and structural measures like levees have reduced loss of lives, but hard defences against flooding or sea level rise can also be maladaptive .  Protection and restoration of coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems could reduce emissions and/or increase carbon uptake and storage . Coastal wetlands protect against coastal erosion and flooding. Strengthening precautionary approaches, such as rebuilding overexploited or depleted fisheries, and responsiveness of existing fisheries management strategies reduces negative climate change impacts on fisheries, with benefits for regional economies and livelihoods. Ecosystem-based management in fisheries and aquaculture supports food security, biodiversity, human health and well-being.
Health and Nutrition  Human health will benefit from integrated mitigation and adaptation options that mainstream health into food, infrastructure, social protection, and water policies . Balanced and sustainable healthy diets and reduced food loss and waste present important opportunities for adaptation and mitigation while generating significant co-benefits in terms of biodiversity and human health. Public health policies to improve nutrition, such as increasing the diversity of food sources in public procurement, health insurance, financial incentives, and awareness-raising campaigns, can potentially influence food demand, reduce food waste, reduce healthcare costs, contribute to lower GHG emissions and enhance adaptive capacity. Improved access to clean energy sources and technologies, and shifts to active mobility and public transport can deliver socioeconomic, air quality and health benefits, especially for women and children.  Effective adaptation options exist to help protect human health and well-being. Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems are effective for extreme heat . Effective options for water-borne and food-borne diseases include improving access to potable water, reducing exposure of water and sanitation systems to flooding and extreme weather events, and improved early warning systems. For vector-borne diseases, effective adaptation options include surveillance, early warning systems, and vaccine development. Effective adaptation options for reducing mental health risks under climate change include improving surveillance and access to mental health care, and monitoring of psychosocial impacts from extreme weather events. A key pathway to climate resilience in the health sector is universal access to healthcare.
Co-Benefits of Adaptation and Mitigation for Sustainable Development Goals  Mitigation and adaptation actions have more synergies than trade-offs with Sustainable Development Goals . Synergies and trade-offs depend on context and scale of implementation. Potential trade-offs can be compensated or avoided with additional policies, investments and financial partnerships. Many mitigation and adaptation actions have multiple synergies with Sustainable Development Goals, but some actions can also have trade-offs. Potential synergies with SDGs exceed potential trade-offs. Synergies and trade-offs are context specific and depend on: means and scale of implementation, intra- and inter-sectoral interactions, cooperation between countries and regions, the sequencing, timing and stringency of actions, governance, and policy design. Eradicating extreme poverty, energy poverty, and providing decent living standards to all, consistent with nearterm sustainable development objectives, can be achieved without significant global emissions growth.  Several mitigation and adaptation options can harness nearterm synergies and reduce trade-offs to advance sustainable development in energy, urban and land systems . Clean energy supply systems have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. Heat Health Action Plans that include early warning and response systems, approaches that mainstream health into food, livelihoods, social protection, water and sanitation benefit health and wellbeing. There are potential synergies between multiple Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable land use and urban planning with more green spaces, reduced air pollution, and demand-side mitigation including shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets. Electrification combined with low-GHG energy, and shifts to public transport can enhance health, employment, and can contribute to energy security and deliver equity. Conservation, protection and restoration of terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and ocean ecosystems, together with targeted management to adapt to unavoidable impacts of climate change can generate multiple additional benefits, such as agricultural productivity, food security, and biodiversity conservation.  When implementing mitigation and adaptation together, and taking trade-offs into account, multiple co-benefits and synergies for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health can be realised. There is a strong link between sustainable development, vulnerability and climate risks. Social safety nets that support climate change adaptation have strong co-benefits with development goals such as education, poverty alleviation, gender inclusion and food security. Land restoration contributes to mitigation and adaptation with synergies via enhanced ecosystem services and with economically positive returns and co-benefits for poverty reduction and improved livelihoods. Trade-offs can be evaluated and minimised by giving emphasis to capacity building, finance, technology transfer, investments; governance, development, context specific gender-based and other social equity considerations with meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples, local communities and vulnerable populations. .  Context relevant design and implementation requires considering people’s needs, biodiversity, and other sustainable development dimensions. Countries at all stages of economic development seek to improve the well-being of people, and their development priorities reflect different starting points and contexts. Different contexts include but are not limited to social, economic, environmental, cultural, or political circumstances, resource endowment, capabilities, international environment, and prior development. n regions with high dependency on fossil fuels for, among other things, revenue and employment generation, mitigating risks for sustainable development requires policies that promote economic and energy sector diversification and considerations of just transitions principles, processes and practices. For individuals and households in low-lying coastal areas, in Small Islands, and smallholder farmers transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits. Effective governance is needed to limit trade-offs of some mitigation options such as large scale afforestation and bioenergy options due to risks from their deployment for food systems, biodiversity, other ecosystem functions and services, and livelihoods. Effective governance requires adequate institutional capacity at all levels .
Finance for Mitigation and Adaptation Actions  Improved availability and access to finance will enable accelerated climate action. Addressing needs and gaps and broadening equitable access to domestic and international finance, when combined with other supportive actions, can act as a catalyst for accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways. Climate resilient development is enabled by increased international cooperation including improved access to financial resources, particularly for vulnerable regions, sectors and groups, and inclusive governance and coordinated policies . Accelerated international financial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG and just transitions, and can address inequities in access to finance and the costs of, and vulnerability to, the impacts of climate change.  Both adaptation and mitigation finance need to increase many-fold, to address rising climate risks and to accelerate investments in emissions reduction. Increased finance would address soft limits to adaptation and rising climate risks while also averting some related losses and damages, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. Enhanced mobilisation of and access to finance, together with building capacity, are essential for implementation of adaptation actions and to reduce adaptation gaps given rising risks and costs, especially for the most vulnerable groups, regions and sectors . Public finance is an important enabler of adaptation and mitigation, and can also leverage private finance. Adaptation funding predominately comes from public sources, and public mechanisms and finance can leverage private sector finance by addressing real and perceived regulatory, cost and market barriers, for instance via public-private partnerships. Financial and technological resources enable effective and ongoing implementation of adaptation, especially when supported by institutions with a strong understanding of adaptation needs and capacity. Average annual modelled mitigation investment requirements for 2020 to 2030 in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C or 1.5°C are a factor of three to six greater than current levels, and total mitigation investments would need to increase across all sectors and regions. Even if extensive global mitigation efforts are implemented, there will be a large need for financial, technical, and human resources for adaptation .
Energy Systems  Rapid and deep reductions in GHG emissions require major energy system transitions. Adaptation options can help reduce climate-related risks to the energy system . Net zero CO2 energy systems entail: a substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use, minimal use of unabated fossil fuels 153, and use of Carbon Capture and Storage in the remaining fossil fuel systems; electricity systems that emit no net CO 2; widespread electrification; alternative energy carriers in applications less amenable to electrification; energy conservation and efficiency; and greater integration across the energy system . Large contributions to emissions reductions can come from options costing less than USD 20 tCO 2 -eq –1, including solar and wind energy, energy efficiency improvements, and CH4 emissions reductions  . 154 Many of these response options are technically viable and are supported by the public. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems.  Climate change and related extreme events will affect future energy systems, including hydropower production, bioenergy yields, thermal power plant efficiencies, and demands for heating and cooling . The most feasible energy system adaptation options support infrastructure resilience, reliable power systems and efficient water use for existing and new energy generation systems . Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming . Energy generation diversification  and demand side management  can increase energy reliability and reduce vulnerabilities to climate change, especially in rural populations . Climate responsive energy markets, updated design standards on energy assets according to current and projected climate change, smart-grid technologies, robust transmission systems and improved capacity to respond to supply deficits have high feasibility in the medium- to long-term, with mitigation co-benefits .
Society, Livelihoods, and Economies  Enhancing knowledge on risks and available adaptation options promotes societal responses, and behaviour and lifestyle changes supported by policies, infrastructure and technology can help reduce global GHG emissions. Climate literacy and information provided through climate services and community approaches, including those that are informed by Indigenous Knowledge and local knowledge, can accelerate behavioural changes and planning . Educational and information programmes, using the arts, participatory modelling and citizen science can facilitate awareness, heighten risk perception, and influence behaviours . The way choices are presented can enable adoption of low GHG intensive socio-cultural options, such as shifts to balanced, sustainable healthy diets, reduced food waste, and active mobility. Judicious labelling, framing, and communication of social norms can increase the effect of mandates, subsidies, or taxes.  A range of adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing approaches, have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater risk reduction benefits when combined . Climate services that are demand-driven and inclusive of different users and providers can improve agricultural practices, inform better water use and efficiency, and enable resilient infrastructure planning. Policy mixes that include weather and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems combined with effective contingency plans, can reduce vulnerability and exposure of human systems. Integrating climate adaptation into social protection programs, including cash transfers and public works programs, is highly feasible and increases resilience to climate change, especially when supported by basic services and infrastructure. Social safety nets can build adaptive capacities, reduce socioeconomic vulnerability, and reduce risk linked to hazards.  Reducing future risks of involuntary migration and displacement due to climate change is possible through cooperative, international efforts to enhance institutional adaptive capacity and sustainable development. Increasing adaptive capacity minimises risk associated with involuntary migration and immobility and improves the degree of choice under which migration decisions are made, while policy interventions can remove barriers and expand the alternatives for safe, orderly and regular migration that allows vulnerable people to adapt to climate change.  Accelerating commitment and follow-through by the private sector is promoted for instance by building business cases for adaptation, accountability and transparency mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation of adaptation progress . Integrated pathways for managing climate risks will be most suitable when so-called ‘low-regret’ anticipatory options are established jointly across sectors in a timely manner and are feasible and effective in their local context, and when path dependencies and maladaptations across sectors are avoided. Sustained adaptation actions are strengthened by mainstreaming adaptation into institutional budget and policy planning cycles, statutory planning, monitoring and evaluation frameworks and into recovery efforts from disaster events. Instruments that incorporate adaptation such as policy and legal frameworks, behavioural incentives, and economic instruments that address market failures, such as climate risk disclosure, inclusive and deliberative processes strengthen adaptation actions by public and private actors.
Industry  There are several options to reduce industrial emissions that differ by type of industry; many industries are disrupted by climate change, especially from extreme events . Reducing industry emissions will entail coordinated action throughout value chains to promote all mitigation options, including demand management, energy and materials efficiency, circular material flows, as well as abatement technologies and transformational changes in production processes. Light industry and manufacturing can be largely decarbonized through available abatement technologies, electrification, and switching to low- and zero-GHG emitting fuels  , while deep reduction of cement process emissions will rely on cementitious material substitution and the availability of Carbon Capture and Storage until new chemistries are mastered. Reducing emissions from the production and use of chemicals would need to rely on a life cycle approach, including increased plastics recycling, fuel and feedstock switching, and carbon sourced through biogenic sources, and, depending on availability, Carbon Capture and Utilisation, direct air CO2 capture, as well as CCS. Action to reduce industry sector emissions may change the location of GHG-intensive industries and the organisation of value chains, with distributional effects on employment and economic structure.  Many industrial and service sectors are negatively affected by climate change through supply and operational disruptions, especially from extreme events, and will require adaptation efforts. Water intensive industries can undertake measures to reduce water stress, such as water recycling and reuse, using brackish or saline sources, working to improve water use efficiency. However, residual risks will remain, especially at higher levels of warming .
Cities, Settlements and Infrastructure  Urban systems are critical for achieving deep emissions reductions and advancing climate resilient development, particularly when this involves integrated planning that incorporates physical, natural and social infrastructure . Deep emissions reductions and integrated adaptation actions are advanced by: integrated, inclusive land use planning and decision-making; compact urban form by co-locating jobs and housing; reducing or changing urban energy and material consumption; electrification in combination with low emissions sources; improved water and waste management infrastructure; and enhancing carbon uptake and storage in the urban environment . Cities can achieve net zero emissions if emissions are reduced within and outside of their administrative boundaries through supply chains, creating beneficial cascading effects across other sectors.  Considering climate change impacts and risks  in the design and planning of urban and rural settlements and infrastructure is critical for resilience and enhancing human well-being. Effective mitigation can be advanced at each of the design, construction, retrofit, use and disposal stages for buildings. Mitigation interventions for buildings include: at the construction phase, lowemission construction materials, highly efficient building envelope and the integration of renewable energy solutions; at the use phase, highly efficient appliances/equipment, the optimisation of the use of buildings and their supply with low-emission energy sources; and at the disposal phase, recycling and re-using construction materials. Sufficiency 155 measures can limit the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and appliances.   Transport-related GHG emissions can be reduced by demand-side options and low-GHG emissions technologies. Changes in urban form, reallocation of street space for cycling and walking, digitalisation and programs that encourage changes in consumer behaviour can reduce demand for transport services and support the shift to more energy efficient transport modes. Electric vehicles powered by low-emissions electricity offer the largest decarbonisation potential for land-based transport, on a life cycle basis. Costs of electrified vehicles are decreasing and their adoption is accelerating, but they require continued investments in supporting infrastructure to increase scale of deployment. The environmental footprint of battery production and growing concerns about critical minerals can be addressed by material and supply diversification strategies, energy and material efficiency improvements, and circular material flows . Advances in battery technologies could facilitate the electrification of heavy-duty trucks and compliment conventional electric rail systems. Sustainable biofuels can offer additional mitigation benefits in land-based transport in the short and medium term. Sustainable biofuels, low-emissions hydrogen, and derivatives can support mitigation of CO2 emissions from shipping, aviation, and heavy-duty land transport but require production process improvements and cost reductions. Key infrastructure systems including sanitation, water, health, transport, communications and energy will be increasingly vulnerable if design standards do not account for changing climate conditions.  Green/natural and blue infrastructure such as urban forestry, green roofs, ponds and lakes, and river restoration can mitigate climate change through carbon uptake and storage, avoided emissions, and reduced energy use while reducing risk from extreme events such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and droughts, and advancing co-benefits for health, well-being and livelihoods. Urban greening can provide local cooling. Combining green/natural and grey/physical infrastructure adaptation responses has potential to reduce adaptation costs and contribute to flood control, sanitation, water resources management, landslide prevention and coastal protection. Globally, more financing is directed at grey/physical infrastructure than green/natural infrastructure and social infrastructure, and there is limited evidence of investment in informal settlements . The greatest gains in well-being in urban areas can be achieved by prioritising finance to reduce climate risk for low-income and marginalised communities including people living in informal settlements.  Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence in low-lying coastal cities and settlements and small islands include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and development priorities, and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes. 
Integration of Near-Term Actions Across Sectors and Systems  The feasibility, effectiveness and benefits of mitigation and adaptation actions are increased when multi-sectoral solutions are undertaken that cut across systems. When such options are combined with broader sustainable development objectives, they can yield greater benefits for human well-being, social equity and justice, and ecosystem and planetary health. Climate resilient development strategies that treat climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human society as parts of an integrated system are the most effective. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Climate resilient development is enabled when decision-making processes and actions are integrated across sectors. Synergies with and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals enhance prospects for climate resilient development. Choices and actions that treat humans and ecosystems as an integrated system build on diverse knowledge about climate risk, equitable, just and inclusive approaches, and ecosystem stewardship.  Approaches that align goals and actions across sectors provide opportunities for multiple and large-scale benefits and avoided damages in the near term. Such measures can also achieve greater benefits through cascading effects across sectors . For example, the feasibility of using land for both agriculture and centralised solar production can increase when such options are combined. Similarly, integrated transport and energy infrastructure planning and operations can together reduce the environmental, social, and economic impacts of decarbonising the transport and energy sectors. The implementation of packages of multiple city-scale mitigation strategies can have cascading effects across sectors and reduce GHG emissions both within and outside a city’s administrative boundaries . Integrated design approaches to the construction and retrofit of buildings provide increasing examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings in several regions. To minimise maladaptation, multi-sectoral, multi-actor and inclusive planning with flexible pathways encourages low-regret and timely actions that keep options open, ensure benefits in multiple sectors and systems and suggest the available solution space for adapting to long-term climate change . Trade-offs in terms of employment, water use, land-use competition and biodiversity, as well as access to, and the affordability of, energy, food, and water can be avoided by well-implemented land-based mitigation options, especially those that do not threaten existing sustainable land uses and land rights, with frameworks for integrated policy implementation.  Mitigation and adaptation when implemented together, and combined with broader sustainable development objectives, would yield multiple benefits for human well-being as well as ecosystem and planetary health. The range of such positive interactions is significant in the landscape of near-term climate policies across regions, sectors and systems. For example, AFOLU mitigation actions in land-use change and forestry, when sustainably implemented, can provide large-scale GHG emission reductions and removals that simultaneously benefit biodiversity, food security, wood supply and other ecosystem services but cannot fully compensate for delayed mitigation action in other sectors. Adaptation measures in land, ocean and ecosystems similarly can have widespread benefits for food security, nutrition, health and well-being, ecosystems and biodiversity. Equally, urban systems are critical, interconnected sites for climate resilient development; urban policies that implement multiple interventions can yield adaptation or mitigation gains with equity and human well-being. Integrated policy packages can improve the ability to integrate considerations of equity, gender equality and justice. Coordinated cross-sectoral policies and planning can maximise synergies and avoid or reduce trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation. Effective action in all of the above areas will require near-term political commitment and follow-through, social cooperation, finance, and more integrated cross-sectoral policies and support and actions. .
Observed Changes, Impacts and Attribution  Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850–1900 in 2011–2020. Global greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase over 2010–2019, with unequal historical and ongoing contributions arising from unsustainable energy use, land use and land-use change, lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production across regions, between and within countries, and between individuals. Human-caused climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe. This has led to widespread adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society and related losses and damages to nature and people. Vulnerable communities who have historically contributed the least to current climate change are disproportionately affected.
Mitigation Actions to Date  There has been a consistent expansion of policies and laws addressing mitigation since AR5. Climate governance supports mitigation by providing frameworks through which diverse actors interact, and a basis for policy development and implementation. Many regulatory and economic instruments have already been deployed successfully. By 2020, laws primarily focussed on reducing GHG emissions existed in 56 countries covering 53% of global emissions. The application of diverse policy instruments for mitigation at the national and sub-national levels has grown consistently across a range of sectors. Policy coverage is uneven across sectors and remains limited for emissions from agriculture, and from industrial materials and feedstocks.  Practical experience has informed economic instrument design and helped to improve predictability, environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, alignment with distributional goals, and social acceptance. Low-emission technological innovation is strengthened through the combination of technology-push policies, together with policies that create incentives for behaviour change and market opportunities. Comprehensive and consistent policy packages have been found to be more effective than single policies. Combining mitigation with policies to shift development pathways, policies that induce lifestyle or behaviour changes, for example, measures promoting walkable urban areas combined with electrification and renewable energy can create health co-benefits from cleaner air and enhanced active mobility . Climate governance enables mitigation by providing an overall direction, setting targets, mainstreaming climate action across policy domains and levels, based on national circumstances and in the context of international cooperation. Effective governance enhances regulatory certainty, creating specialised organisations and creating the context to mobilise finance. These functions can be promoted by climate-relevant laws, which are growing in number, or climate strategies, among others, based on national and sub-national context. Effective and equitable climate governance builds on engagement with civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples and local communities.  The unit costs of several low-emission technologies, including solar, wind and lithium-ion batteries, have fallen consistently since 2010. Design and process innovations in combination with the use of digital technologies have led to near-commercial availability of many low or zero emissions options in buildings, transport and industry. From 2010-2019, there have been sustained decreases in the unit costs of solar energy , wind energy, and lithium-ion batteries, and large increases in their deployment, e.g., >10× for solar and >100× for electric vehicles, albeit varying widely across regions. Electricity from PV and wind is now cheaper than electricity from fossil sources in many regions, electric vehicles are increasingly competitive with internal combustion engines, and large-scale battery storage on electricity grids is increasingly viable. In comparison to modular small-unit size technologies, the empirical record shows that multiple large-scale mitigation technologies, with fewer opportunities for learning, have seen minimal cost reductions and their adoption has grown slowly. Maintaining emission-intensive systems may, in some regions and sectors, be more expensive than transitioning to low emission systems.  For almost all basic materials – primary metals, building materials and chemicals – many low- to zero-GHG intensity production processes are at the pilot to near-commercial and in some cases commercial stage but they are not yet established industrial practice. Integrated design in construction and retrofit of buildings has led to increasing examples of zero energy or zero carbon buildings. Technological innovation made possible the widespread adoption of LED lighting. Digital technologies including sensors, the internet of things, robotics, and artificial intelligence can improve energy management in all sectors; they can increase energy efficiency, and promote the adoption of many low-emission technologies, including decentralised renewable energy, while creating economic opportunities. However, some of these climate change mitigation gains can be reduced or counterbalanced by growth in demand for goods and services due to the use of digital devices. Several mitigation options, notably solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency, demand side management, improved forest- and crop/grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss, are technically viable, are becoming increasingly cost effective and are generally supported by the public, and this enables expanded deployment in many regions.  The magnitude of global climate finance flows has increased and financing channels have broadened. Annual tracked total financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation increased by up to 60% between 2013/14 and 2019/20, but average growth has slowed since 2018 and most climate finance stays within national borders. Markets for green bonds, environmental, social and governance and sustainable finance products have expanded significantly since AR5 . Investors, central banks, and financial regulators are driving increased awareness of climate risk to support climate policy development and implementation. Accelerated international financial cooperation is a critical enabler of low-GHG and just transitions.  Economic instruments have been effective in reducing emissions, complemented by regulatory instruments mainly at the national and also sub-national and regional level. By 2020, over 20% of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, although coverage and prices have been insufficient to achieve deep reductions. Equity and distributional impacts of carbon pricing instruments can be addressed by using revenue from carbon taxes or emissions trading to support low-income households, among other approaches. The mix of policy instruments which reduced costs and stimulated adoption of solar energy, wind energy and lithium-ion batteries includes public R&D, funding for demonstration and pilot projects, and demand-pull instruments such as deployment subsidies to attain scale .  Mitigation actions, supported by policies, have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity between 2010 and 2019, with a growing number of countries achieving absolute GHG emission reductions for more than a decade . While global net GHG emissions have increased since 2010, global energy intensity decreased by 2% yr –1 between 2010 and 2019. Global carbon intensity also decreased by 0.3% yr –1 , mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large regional variations over the same period. In many countries, policies have enhanced energy efficiency, reduced rates of deforestation and accelerated technology deployment, leading to avoided and in some cases reduced or removed emissions. At least 18 countries have sustained production-based CO2 and GHG and consumption-based CO2 absolute emission reductions for longer than 10 years since 2005 through energy supply decarbonization, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and changes in economic structure. Some countries have reduced production-based GHG emissions by a third or more since peaking, and some have achieved reduction rates of around 4% yr–1 for several years consecutively. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that mitigation policies have led to avoided global emissions of several GtCO 2-eq yr–1. At least 1.8 GtCO2-eq yr–1 of avoided emissions can be accounted for by aggregating separate estimates for the effects of economic and regulatory instruments. Growing numbers of laws and executive orders have impacted global emissions and are estimated to have resulted in 5.9 GtCO2 -eq yr–1 of avoided emissions in 2016. These reductions have only partly offset global emissions growth.
Responses Undertaken to Date  International climate agreements, rising national ambitions for climate action, along with rising public awareness are accelerating efforts to address climate change at multiple levels of governance. Mitigation policies have contributed to a decrease in global energy and carbon intensity, with several countries achieving GHG emission reductions for over a decade. Low-emission technologies are becoming more affordable, with many low or zero emissions options now available for energy, buildings, transport, and industry. Adaptation planning and implementation progress has generated multiple benefits, with effective adaptation options having the potential to reduce climate risks and contribute to sustainable development. Global tracked finance for mitigation and adaptation has seen an upward trend since AR5, but falls short of needs.
Technology Innovation, Adoption, Diffusion and  Transfer Enhancing technology innovation systems can provide opportunities to lower emissions growth and create social and environmental co-benefits. Policy packages tailored to national contexts and technological characteristics have been effective in supporting low-emission innovation and technology diffusion. Support for successful low-carbon technological innovation includes public policies such as training and R&D, complemented by regulatory and market-based instruments that create incentives and market opportunities such as appliance performance standards and building codes.  International cooperation on innovation systems and technology development and transfer, accompanied by capacity building, knowledge sharing, and technical and financial support can accelerate the global diffusion of mitigation technologies, practices and policies and align these with other development objectives. Choice architecture can help end-users adopt technology and low-GHG-intensive options. Adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.  International cooperation on innovation works best when tailored to and beneficial for local value chains, when partners collaborate on an equal footing, and when capacity building is an integral part of the effort.  Technological innovation can have trade-offs that include externalities such as new and greater environmental impacts and social inequalities; rebound effects leading to lower net emission reductions or even emission increases; and overdependence on foreign knowledge and providers. Appropriately designed policies and governance have helped address distributional impacts and rebound effects. For example, digital technologies can promote large increases in energy efficiency through coordination and an economic shift to services. However, societal digitalization can induce greater consumption of goods and energy and increased electronic waste as well as negatively impacting labour markets and worsening inequalities between and within countries. Digitalisation requires appropriate governance and policies in order to enhance mitigation potential. Effective policy packages can help to realise synergies, avoid trade-offs and/or reduce rebound effects: these might include a mix of efficiency targets, performance standards, information provision, carbon pricing, finance and technical assistance .  Technology transfer to expand use of digital technologies for land use monitoring, sustainable land management, and improved agricultural productivity supports reduced emissions from deforestation and land use change while also improving GHG accounting and standardisation .
