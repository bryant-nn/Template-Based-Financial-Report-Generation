Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern 121 are assessed to become high to very high at lower global warming levels compared to what was assessed in AR5. This is based upon recent evidence of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level of global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to multiple times higher than currently observed for 127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people and species.

Overall, delayed action jeopardizes climate-resilient development and amplifies the long-term economic and social costs associated with climate change.\n\nIn summary, the risks of delayed mitigation include increased costs, reduced effectiveness of future climate actions, and heightened threats of irreversible climate impacts.

      "summary": "The urgency of climate action is underscored by the need for rapid, deep, and sustained mitigation and adaptation efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. Immediate actions are critical as they prevent the lock-in of high-emission infrastructure, reduce future adaptation costs, and minimize irreversible climate changes. Delaying action increases the risk of severe adverse consequences for ecosystems, human health, and livelihoods. Effective strategies include comprehensive policy packages, aligned multi-level governance, incentives for technological innovation, and international cooperation. These approaches, supported by adequate finance and economic tools, can accelerate climate action and ensure long-term climate stability.\n\nExplanation: Immediate climate action is necessary to address the increasing risks associated with global warming. Near-term emissions reductions are pivotal in achieving climate stability and avoiding severe impacts. By implementing integrated strategies and leveraging international cooperation, the transition to a low-carbon economy can be expedited, ensuring sustainable development and resilience against climate change.",

            "Benefits of Strengthening Near-Term Action  Accelerated implementation of adaptation will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations. Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions would reduce future adaptation costs and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, avoid locking-in emission sources, and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes. These near-term actions involve higher up-front investments and disruptive changes, which can be moderated by a range of enabling conditions and removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility. Accelerated implementation of adaptation responses will bring benefits to human well-being. As adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term planning and accelerated implementation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that constraints remain for some regions.
