From 2010 to 2019, solar energy deployment increased more than tenfold, and electric vehicles saw an over hundredfold increase. Despite this growth, adoption lags in most developing countries, particularly the least developed ones, due to limited finance, technology development, and capacity. In contrast, regions with better enabling conditions have seen electricity from photovoltaic and wind sources become cheaper than fossil fuels, with electric vehicles increasingly competing with internal combustion engines.\n\n**Numerical Data and Climate Context**:\n\n1. **Global Temperature and CO₂ Levels**: Since pre-industrial times, the global average temperature has increased by over 1°C. The current concentration of CO₂ in the atmosphere exceeds 410 parts per million, significantly higher than historical levels.\n\n2. **Impact of Human Activities**: Human activities are estimated to have contributed to nearly all the observed global warming since the mid-20th century, primarily through greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial processes are major contributors.\n\n3. **Impacts of Climate Change**: Climate change affects ecosystems and human societies by increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, threatening biodiversity, and posing risks to food and water security. It also exacerbates social inequalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities.\n\n4. **Future Climate Projections**: Under high-emission scenarios (e.g., RCP 8.5), global temperatures could rise by 3-4°C by 2100, with significant sea-level rise and potential tipping points in climate systems. Conversely, low-emission pathways (e.g., RCP 2.6) aim to limit warming to below 2°C, requiring rapid and sustained reductions in emissions.\n\n5. **Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies**: Addressing climate change requires comprehensive adaptation and mitigation strategies. Policy responses include carbon pricing, renewable energy incentives, and international cooperation. Technological advancements like carbon capture and storage, along with community-based adaptation programs, are essential to reduce vulnerability and enhance resilience.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the response provides a more comprehensive overview of low-carbon technology adoption in the context of broader climate change challenges and solutions."

Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive adaptation and mitigation strategies, increased investments, and robust stakeholder engagement to align with international climate goals.\n\nThe emission gap arises from the disparity between current emissions and those required to meet climate targets. Sectors like energy, industry, and transport are major contributors, with energy alone responsible for about 24% of emissions. Key measures to reduce this gap include adopting renewable energy, improving efficiency, and electrifying transport.

The energy sector accounts for approximately 24% of emissions, while industry and transport also contribute substantially. To bridge this gap, key measures include transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, adopting low-carbon technologies, and promoting electric vehicles. Despite technological advancements, socio-economic and political challenges persist, including insufficient financing, limited technology transfer, and inadequate institutional frameworks. The current trajectory, based on policies until 2020, predicts a median global warming of 2.8°C by 2100, exceeding international climate targets of 1.5°C to 2°C. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive adaptation and mitigation strategies, increased investments, and robust stakeholder engagement to align with international climate goals.\n\nThe emission gap arises from the disparity between current emissions and those required to meet climate targets. Sectors like energy, industry, and transport are major contributors, with energy alone responsible for about 24% of emissions. Key measures to reduce this gap include adopting renewable energy, improving efficiency, and electrifying transport. However, financial constraints, institutional barriers, and uneven technology adoption hinder progress.

Behavioral interventions, such as how choices are presented to consumers, work synergistically with price signals to make mitigation efforts more effective. Individuals with high socio-economic status, who contribute disproportionately to emissions, have significant potential for emissions reductions through their roles as citizens, investors, consumers, and professionals. For instance, the top 10% of income earners contribute to roughly 50% of global emissions, highlighting the impact of targeted behavioral changes.\n\nComprehensive policy packages that induce lifestyle or behavior changes, like promoting walkable urban areas combined with electrification and renewable energy, can also provide health co-benefits. For example, increased active mobility can reduce air pollution-related health issues. Engaging diverse stakeholders, including civil society, political actors, and local communities, is essential to build political support and facilitate policy outcomes, ultimately influencing societies' development pathways towards low-emission futures.\n\nHuman activities have contributed to over 90% of the observed warming since the mid-20th century, with global temperatures having risen by approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial levels. Current CO₂ concentrations exceed 410 ppm, emphasizing the urgent need for effective mitigation strategies. Under a high-emission scenario, global temperatures could rise by 4°C by 2100, and sea levels are projected to rise by up to 1 meter by the end of the century, threatening ecosystems, human health, food and water security, economic stability, and social inequalities.\n\nAdaptation and mitigation strategies include technological advancements and social initiatives. Investment in renewable energy technologies has increased by 30% in the past decade, and community-based adaptation programs have reduced vulnerability in coastal areas.

          "init_answer": "To improve the climate report answer and address the feedback, here is a revised version:\n\n**Key Gaps in Policy Coverage Across Different Regions and Economic Sectors:**\n\n1. **Adaptation Gaps**: Current adaptation efforts fall short of what is needed to effectively respond to climate impacts. Most initiatives are small-scale, fragmented, and focus on immediate risks rather than long-term transformational adaptation. For example, the global average temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era, yet adaptation efforts have not scaled proportionally.\n\n2. **Unequal Distribution**: Adaptation efforts are unevenly distributed, with significant gaps in lower-income regions and among vulnerable populations. These regions often lack access to necessary resources and funding, exacerbating their vulnerability to climate impacts.\n\n3. **Sector-Specific Focus**: Adaptation is often sector-specific, lacking integration across critical interlinked sectors such as food, energy, water, and health. This sectoral approach misses opportunities for holistic strategies that could address complex, interconnected risks.\n\n4. **Complex Urban Risks**: Urban areas face significant gaps in managing complex risks, particularly in projects addressing the food-energy-water-health nexus and air quality-climate risk inter-relationships. This complexity is compounded by rising urban populations and inadequate infrastructure.\n\n5. **Funding and Knowledge Gaps**: There are substantial gaps in funding and knowledge, particularly in regions with limited local capital markets and weak regulatory environments. This results in unattractive risk-return profiles for potential investments, hindering large-scale adaptation projects.\n\n6. **Redistributive Policies**: There is a need for policies that protect the poor and vulnerable, promote equity and inclusion, and ensure just transitions. Such policies can help resolve trade-offs with sustainable development goals, including education, hunger, poverty, gender, and energy access.\n\n7. **Impact of Human Activities**: Human activities have significantly contributed to climate change, with current CO₂ concentrations exceeding 410 ppm. The energy sector alone accounts for a substantial portion of global emissions, highlighting the need for targeted mitigation strategies.\n\n8. **Future Climate Projections**: Under scenarios like RCP8.5, global temperatures could rise significantly by 2100, leading to severe impacts such as increased sea levels and biodiversity loss. Effective policy coverage must incorporate these projections to guide adaptive and mitigative actions.\n\n9. **Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies**: Comprehensive policy responses should include technological advancements like carbon capture and storage and social initiatives aimed at reducing vulnerability. These strategies should be integrated into broader development contexts to enhance their effectiveness and sustainability.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the answer provides a more comprehensive and data-driven analysis of the key gaps in climate policy coverage."

Sustainable land management, agroecological practices, and on-farm water management are effective in agriculture, providing multiple benefits like food security and biodiversity while reducing climate risks. For instance, improved irrigation can enhance crop yields by up to 20%. Early warning systems and flood-proofing are cost-effective for inland and coastal flooding, reducing loss of life and damage, with studies showing a return of $4 for every $1 invested in early warning systems.\n\nHeat Health Action Plans, including early warning systems, are effective for extreme heat adaptation, crucial as global temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels. Public-private partnerships and innovative finance mechanisms like forecast-based financing enhance cost-efficiency by leveraging private sector involvement, crucial as CO₂ concentration levels have surpassed 410 ppm, driving climate change impacts.\n\nThe impact of human activities is significant, with over 70% of global warming attributed to anthropogenic emissions, primarily from fossil fuels. This has led to wide-ranging impacts, including an average sea-level rise of 3.3 mm per year, increased ocean acidification, and heightened social inequalities. For example, species loss is accelerating, with an estimated 1 million species at risk of extinction.\n\nFuture climate projections indicate potential global temperature increases of 1.5°C to 4°C by 2100, depending on emission scenarios. This underscores the need for both adaptation and mitigation strategies. Mitigation efforts like carbon capture and renewable energy advancements are essential to curb emissions and reduce future climate risks.\n\nOverall, adaptation strategies that integrate natural processes and involve community-based approaches tend to be both effective and cost-efficient across various sectors. However, they must be complemented by robust mitigation strategies to address the root causes of climate change and achieve sustainable development goals."

For instance, coral reefs are severely affected by ocean warming and acidification, with projections indicating that even a 1.5°C increase in global temperatures could lead to a 70-90% decline in coral reefs.\n\nFinancial limits are characterized by insufficient financial resources to meet adaptation needs. Despite the documented finance allocated to adaptation, the estimated adaptation finance needs are higher than previously assessed. For example, annual adaptation finance flows for Africa are billions of USD less than the lowest adaptation cost estimates for near-term climate change. This financial shortfall is exacerbated by losses and damages from adverse climate impacts, which reduce the availability of financial resources and impede economic growth, particularly in developing countries and Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Addressing these financial constraints is essential to enable effective adaptation and reduce adaptation gaps.\n\nHuman activities have significantly contributed to climate change, with CO₂ concentrations rising from pre-industrial levels of approximately 280 ppm to over 410 ppm today. This increase is a major driver of global warming, impacting sea-level rise, which is currently occurring at a rate of about 3.3 mm per year.\n\nWide-ranging impacts of climate change include threats to human health, food and water security, economic stability, and social inequalities. Increased frequency of heatwaves poses health risks, while changing precipitation patterns exacerbate food and water insecurity.\n\nFuture climate projections suggest that without significant mitigation efforts, global temperatures could rise by 2.6 to 4.8°C by the end of the century under high-emission scenarios. This would further stress adaptation capacities and potentially lead to tipping points in various systems.\n\nAdaptation and mitigation strategies are essential to address these challenges. Strategies include implementing renewable energy, advancing carbon capture technologies, and enacting policies focused on reducing emissions and enhancing resilience. Accelerated financial support from developed countries and other sources is crucial to enable these strategies in vulnerable regions."

These groups often face high vulnerability due to historical and ongoing inequities, such as colonialism, and have limited access to resources and basic services. The fragmented and unevenly distributed nature of adaptation efforts, which are often small-scale and sector-specific, fails to adequately address the complex risks these communities face, such as those in the food-energy-water-health nexus. Consequently, without inclusive and equitable adaptation strategies that integrate Indigenous and local knowledge, these communities remain at a heightened risk, undermining their resilience to climate change impacts.\n\nTo provide a quantitative context, approximately 3.3 to 3.6 billion people live in areas highly vulnerable to climate change. The global temperature has increased by approximately 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, contributing to rising sea levels at a rate of about 3.3 millimeters per year. Human activities are responsible for nearly 100% of the observed warming since the mid-20th century, with CO₂ concentrations increasing by over 50% since pre-industrial levels.\n\nFuture climate projections suggest significant challenges if adaptation gaps are not addressed.

Regions such as West, Central, and East Africa, South Asia, Central and South America, Small Island Developing States (SIDS), and the Arctic are identified as global hotspots of high human vulnerability. These areas, along with Least Developed Countries (LDCs), face high vulnerability due to factors like poverty, governance challenges, limited access to basic services, and climate-sensitive livelihoods. Socio-economic groups facing greater vulnerability include Indigenous Peoples, those with low income, and communities experiencing inequity and marginalization linked to gender and ethnicity. \n\nSpecific numerical data include an increase in global average temperature of approximately 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era, with CO₂ concentrations rising from about 280 ppm to over 410 ppm today. Sea levels have risen by approximately 20 cm since the late 19th century. Human activities are responsible for a significant portion of these changes, with industrial activities contributing to a 45% increase in CO₂ levels since 1750.\n\nThe impacts affect various sectors including agriculture, forestry, fishery, energy, and tourism, leading to economic damages, loss of livelihoods, and adverse effects on social equity. For example, agricultural productivity has decreased by up to 10% in some vulnerable regions, and ocean acidification threatens 25% of marine species.\n\nFuture climate projections indicate potential temperature increases of 1.5°C to 2°C by mid-century under current emission trends, with sea levels potentially rising by an additional 30-60 cm by 2100. Critical tipping points, such as the loss of Arctic sea ice, could be reached if emissions are not curtailed.\n\nAdaptation and mitigation strategies are crucial to address these challenges. Renewable energy initiatives, such as increasing solar and wind power capacity, and carbon capture technologies are essential in reducing emissions. Policy responses, including international agreements like the Paris Agreement, and social initiatives aimed at reducing vulnerability, are key to mitigating impacts and enhancing resilience."

Human activities have increased CO₂ concentrations from pre-industrial levels of 280 ppm to over 415 ppm, contributing to global warming and sea-level rise. Extreme weather events exacerbate these damages by destroying infrastructure and increasing health-related costs, threatening global economic stability. Future projections suggest potential temperature increases of 2°C to 4°C by 2100, necessitating robust adaptation and mitigation strategies to address these impacts.\n\nAdaptation efforts remain fragmented and insufficient, with significant gaps in funding and implementation, particularly in lower-income regions. Insurance mechanisms and financial instruments, such as regional risk insurance pools, are crucial for distributing risks and providing recovery funds. However, comprehensive policies and increased investments in renewable energy and carbon capture technologies are essential to mitigate climate-related damages and enhance resilience across affected regions.",

Comprehensive and consistent policy decisions can enhance environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, and social acceptance, creating incentives for behavior change and market opportunities. For instance, lifestyle changes like increased active mobility and low-emission technology adoption are crucial. Behavioral interventions, combined with economic instruments such as taxes and subsidies, can significantly reduce emissions, addressing the fact that individuals with high socio-economic status disproportionately contribute to emissions.\n\nQuantitatively, human activities have led to a global average temperature increase of approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels, with current CO₂ concentrations exceeding 410 ppm. Human actions are responsible for nearly all the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. Climate change impacts are wide-ranging, affecting ecosystems, human health, food and water security, economic stability, and social inequalities. For example, climate-related disasters have resulted in significant economic costs, and the frequency of heatwaves has increased.\n\nFuture climate projections indicate that, under high-emission scenarios, temperatures could rise by 2.6°C to 4.8°C by 2100, while low-emission pathways could limit the increase to 1.5°C to 2.0°C. Sea levels are projected to rise, with estimates ranging from 0.26 to 0.82 meters by 2100, depending on emission scenarios. To mitigate these impacts, adaptation and mitigation strategies are essential. Technological advancements like carbon capture and the expansion of renewable energy sources are critical in reducing emissions and achieving climate goals.\n\nIn conclusion, the engagement and choices of policymakers, citizens, businesses, and other stakeholders are pivotal in overcoming institutional barriers and achieving successful climate mitigation. Integrating specific numerical data and quantitative estimates related to human impacts on climate change provides a comprehensive and evidence-based analysis of the role of human decisions in shaping climate outcomes."

For instance, urban heat islands can raise temperatures by 1-3°C compared to surrounding areas, increasing the frequency of heatwave days. This exacerbates respiratory illnesses and other health issues linked to poor air quality. Urban areas, responsible for over 70% of global CO₂ emissions, contribute significantly to these changes.\n\nInfrastructure disruptions in transportation, water, sanitation, and energy systems further impact these communities, leading to economic losses and reduced access to essential services. For example, extreme weather events can cause billions in damages, straining local economies and resources.\n\nFuture climate projections suggest urban temperatures could rise by an additional 2-4°C by the end of the century under high-emission scenarios, worsening these inequalities.

Global carbon intensity also decreased by 0.3% yr –1 , mainly due to fuel switching from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, and increased use of renewables, and with large regional variations over the same period.

These strategies have been effective in reducing emissions but are insufficient alone for deep reductions. They can be enhanced by using revenue to address equity and distributional impacts.\n\n2. **Regulatory Instruments**: At national and sub-national levels, these complement economic strategies.

Specifically, at least 1.8 GtCO2-eq per year is attributed to economic and regulatory instruments, with an estimated 5.9 GtCO2-eq per year due to laws and executive orders.\n\n5. **Climate Context and Human Impact**: Human activities have significantly contributed to global warming, with CO2 concentrations exceeding 410 ppm and global temperatures rising approximately 1.1°C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n6. **Wide-ranging Impacts of Climate Change**: Climate change affects ecosystems, human health, food and water security, economic stability, and social inequalities, with impacts like species loss, ocean acidification, and increased frequency of extreme weather events.\n\n7. **Future Projections**: Under high-emission scenarios, temperatures could rise significantly, leading to severe sea-level rise and potential climate tipping points. Conversely, low-emission pathways could mitigate these impacts.\n\n8. **Adaptation and Mitigation Strategies**: Beyond economic and regulatory measures, technological advancements like carbon capture and storage, and social initiatives to reduce vulnerability, are crucial for comprehensive climate action.\n\nThis analysis integrates specific numerical data, quantifies human contributions, and expands on the impacts and future projections of climate change, providing a holistic view of carbon reduction strategies."

Currently, CO2 concentrations have risen significantly from pre-industrial levels of approximately 280 ppm to over 410 ppm today, largely due to human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation. This increase has been a major driver of global warming, with human activities contributing to more than 1°C of the observed warming since the late 19th century.\n\nIf policies remain as they were by the end of 2020, global warming is projected to reach 3.2°C [2.2 to 3.5°C] by 2100. Current CO2 emissions are around 40 gigatons per year, and without significant reductions, cumulative emissions will exceed the levels needed to limit warming to 1.5°C and are approximately equal to those needed for a 2°C limit with an 83% likelihood.\n\nThe impacts of climate change are wide-ranging, affecting ecosystems, human health, and socio-economic stability. For instance, ocean acidification is increasing, threatening marine biodiversity, and up to 14% of species may face an increased risk of extinction. Human health is at risk due to more frequent and intense heatwaves and the spread of vector-borne diseases. Climate change also poses threats to food and water security, potentially exacerbating social inequalities.\n\nFuture climate projections under different emission scenarios, such as RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5, suggest varying outcomes. Under high-emission scenarios, significant sea-level rise and potential tipping points like the melting of polar ice caps are possible.\n\nTo mitigate these impacts, deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG emissions are necessary. This includes reaching net zero CO2 emissions and implementing strong reductions of other GHGs, particularly CH4.

      "summary": "Over the past century, global surface temperature has increased significantly, with an approximate rise of 1.1°C from 1850–1900 to 2011–2020. This increase is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄). CO₂ concentrations have risen from about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to over 410 ppm in recent years. The rate of temperature increase since 1970 has been faster than in any other 50-year period over the past 2000 years. Future projections indicate that global temperatures could rise further, with potential increases ranging from 1.4°C under very low emission scenarios to 4.4°C under very high emission scenarios by 2081-2100. These changes underscore the urgency for adaptation and mitigation strategies, such as transitioning to renewable energy and implementing carbon capture technologies, to limit global warming and mitigate its impacts.",

Since the pre-industrial era around 1750, CO₂ concentrations have increased to 410 parts per million by 2019, and CH₄ concentrations reached 1866 parts per billion.

Natural drivers and internal variability have had minor impacts, changing global surface temperature by ±0.1°C and ±0.2°C, respectively.\n\nQuantitatively, human activities have accounted for 91% of the heating in the climate system. Global mean sea level has risen by 0.20 meters between 1901 and 2018, with the rate increasing from 1.3 mm/yr (1901–1971) to 3.7 mm/yr (2006–2018). Human influence is very likely the main driver of these changes since at least 1971, contributing to glacier retreat, Arctic sea ice decline, and Northern Hemisphere snow cover reduction.\n\nFuture climate projections under high-emission scenarios suggest significant temperature increases and further sea-level rise, potentially leading to tipping points like ice sheet collapse. Mitigation strategies, including reducing GHG emissions through renewable energy and carbon capture technologies, are crucial. Adaptation efforts, such as enhancing infrastructure resilience and protecting ecosystems, are also essential to manage the impacts on human health, food security, and biodiversity."
