Long-term Climate Change  The uncertainty range on assessed future changes in global surface temperature is narrower than in the AR5. For the first time in an IPCC assessment cycle, multi-model projections of global surface temperature, ocean warming and sea level are constrained using observations and the assessed climate sensitivity. The likely range of equilibrium climate sensitivity has been narrowed to 2.5°C to 4.0°C based on multiple lines of evidence , including improved understanding of cloud feedbacks. For related emissions scenarios, this leads to narrower uncertainty ranges for long-term projected global temperature change than in AR5.  Future warming depends on future GHG emissions, with cumulative net CO 2 dominating. The assessed best estimates and very likely ranges of warming for 2081-2100 with respect to 1850–1900 vary from 1.4 [1.0 to 1.8]°C in the very low GHG emissions scenario to 2.7 [2.1 to 3.5]°C in the intermediate GHG emissions scenario and 4.4 [3.3 to 5.7]°C in the very high GHG emissions scenario 113 .  Modelled pathways consistent with the continuation of policies implemented by the end of 2020 lead to global warming of 3.2 [2.2 to 3.5]°C by 2100 . Pathways of >4°C by 2100 would imply a reversal of current technology and/or mitigation policy trends . However, such warming could occur in emissions pathways consistent with policies implemented by the end of 2020 if climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than the best estimate.  Global warming will continue to increase in the near term in nearly all considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions, reaching net zero CO2 emissions and including strong emissions reductions of other GHGs, in particular CH4, are necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C or less than 2°C by the end of century . The best estimate of reaching 1.5°C of global warming lies in the first half of the 2030s in most of the considered scenarios and modelled pathways 114. In the very low GHG emissions scenario, CO 2 emissions reach net zero around 2050 and the best-estimate end-of-century warming is 1.4°C, after a temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming. Global warming of 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO 2 and other GHG emissions occur in the coming decades. Deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in GHG emissions would lead to improvements in air quality within a few years, to reductions in trends of global surface temperature discernible after around 20 years, and over longer time periods for many other climate impact-drivers 115 . Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality compared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions 116 .   Changes in short-lived climate forcers resulting from the five considered scenarios lead to an additional net global warming in the near and long term. Simultaneous stringent climate change mitigation and air pollution control olicies limit this additional warming and lead to strong benefits for air quality. In high and very high GHG emissions scenarios, combined changes in SLCF emissions, such as CH 4, aerosol and ozone precursors, lead to a net global warming by 2100 of likely 0.4°C to 0.9°C relative to 2019. This is due to projected increases in atmospheric concentration of CH4, tropospheric ozone, hydrofluorocarbons and, when strong air pollution control is considered, reductions of cooling aerosols. In low and very low GHG emissions scenarios, air pollution control policies, reductions in CH 4 and other ozone precursors lead to a net cooling, whereas reductions in anthropogenic cooling aerosols lead to a net warming. Altogether, this causes a likely net warming of 0.0°C to 0.3°C due to SLCF changes in 2100 relative to 2019 and strong reductions in global surface ozone and particulate matter .  Continued GHG emissions will further affect all major climate system components, and many changes will be irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales. Many changes in the climate system become larger in direct relation to increasing global warming. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger. Additional warming will lead to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves and is projected to further amplify permafrost thawing and loss of seasonal snow cover, glaciers, land ice and Arctic sea ice. Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation , and very wet and very dry weather and climate events and seasons. The portion of global land experiencing detectable changes in seasonal mean precipitation is projected to increase with more variable precipitation and surface water flows over most land regions within seasons and from year to year . Many changes due to past and future GHG emissions are irreversible on centennial to millennial time scales, especially in the ocean, ice sheets and global sea level. Ocean acidification , ocean deoxygenation and global mean sea level will continue to increase in the 21st century, at rates dependent on future emissions.  With further global warming, every region is projected to increasingly experience concurrent and multiple changes in climatic impact-drivers. Increases in hot and decreases in cold climatic impact-drivers, such as temperature extremes, are projected in all regions. At 1.5°C global warming, heavy precipitation and flooding events are projected to intensify and become more frequent in most regions in Africa, Asia , North America and Europe . At 2°C or above, these changes expand to more regions and/or become more significant, and more frequent and/or severe agricultural and ecological droughts are projected in Europe, Africa, Australasia and North, Central and South America . Other projected regional changes include intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms , and increases in aridity and fire weather . Compound heatwaves and droughts become likely more frequent, including concurrently at multiple locations.
Overshoot Pathways: Increased Risks and Other  Implications Exceeding a specific remaining carbon budget results in higher global warming. Achieving and sustaining net negative global CO 2 emissions could reverse the resulting temperature exceedance. Continued reductions in emissions of short-lived climate forcers, particularly methane, after peak temperature has been reached, would also further reduce warming. Only a small number of the most ambitious global modelled pathways limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot.  Overshoot of a warming level results in more adverse impacts, some irreversible, and additional risks for human and natural systems compared to staying below that warming level, with risks growing with the magnitude and duration of overshoot. Compared to pathways without overshoot, societies and ecosystems would be exposed to greater and more widespread changes in climatic impact-drivers, such as extreme heat and extreme precipitation, with increasing risks to infrastructure, low-lying coastal settlements, and associated livelihoods. Overshooting 1.5°C will result in irreversible adverse impacts on certain ecosystems with low resilience, such as polar, mountain, and coastal ecosystems, impacted by ice-sheet melt, glacier melt, or by accelerating and higher committed sea level rise. Overshoot increases the risks of severe impacts, such as increased wildfires, mass mortality of trees, drying of peatlands, thawing of permafrost and weakening natural land carbon sinks; such impacts could increase releases of GHGs making temperature reversal more challenging.  The larger the overshoot, the more net negative CO2 emissions needed to return to a given warming level. Reducing global temperature by removing CO 2 would require net negative emissions of 220 GtCO 2 for every tenth of a degree. Modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach median values of cumulative net negative emissions of 220 GtCO2 by 2100, pathways that return warming to 1.5°C after high overshoot reach median values of 360 GtCO2. 137 More rapid reduction in CO 2 and non-CO2 emissions, particularly methane, limits peak warming levels and reduces the requirement for net negative CO2 emissions and CDR, thereby reducing feasibility and sustainability concerns, and social and environmental risks .
Near-Term Risks  Many changes in the climate system, including extreme events, will become larger in the near term with increasing global warming. Multiple climatic and non-climatic risks will interact, resulting in increased compounding and cascading impacts becoming more difficult to manage. Losses and damages will increase with increasing global warming, while strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Continuing with current unsustainable development patterns would increase exposure and vulnerability of ecosystems and people to climate hazards. Global warming will continue to increase in the near term mainly due to increased cumulative CO 2 emissions in nearly all considered scenarios and pathways. In the near term, every region in the world is projected to face further increases in climate hazards , increasing multiple risks to ecosystems and humans. In the near term, natural variability will modulate human-caused changes, either attenuating or amplifying projected changes, especially at regional scales, with little effect on centennial global warming. Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI. The occurrence of individual years with global surface temperature change above a certain level does not imply that this global warming level has been reached. If a large explosive volcanic eruption were to occur in the near term 150, it would temporarily and partially mask human-caused climate change by reducing global surface temperature and precipitation, especially over land, for one to three years.  The level of risk for humans and ecosystems will depend on near-term trends in vulnerability, exposure, level of socio-economic development and adaptation. In the near term, many climate-associated risks to natural and human systems depend more strongly on changes in these systems’ vulnerability and exposure than on differences in climate hazards between emissions scenarios . Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including growing inequality, and when urbanisation or migration increase exposure . Urbanisation increases hot extremes  and precipitation runoff intensity. Increasing urbanisation in low-lying and coastal zones will be a major driver of increasing exposure to extreme riverflow events and sea level rise hazards, increasing risks. Vulnerability will also rise rapidly in low-lying Small Island Developing States and atolls in the context of sea level rise . Human vulnerability will concentrate in informal settlements and rapidly growing smaller settlements; and vulnerability in rural areas will be heightened by reduced habitability and high reliance on climate-sensitive livelihoods. Human and ecosystem vulnerability are interdependent. Vulnerability to climate change for ecosystems will be strongly influenced by past, present, and future patterns of human development, including from unsustainable consumption and production, increasing demographic pressures, and persistent unsustainable use and management of land, ocean, and water. Several near-term risks can be moderated with adaptation.  Principal hazards and associated risks expected in the near term are: • Increased intensity and frequency of hot extremes and dangerous heat-humidity conditions, with increased human mortality, morbidity, and labour productivity loss.  • Increasing frequency of marine heatwaves will increase risks of biodiversity loss in the oceans, including from mass mortality events.  • Near-term risks for biodiversity loss are moderate to high in forest ecosystems and kelp and seagrass ecosystems and are high to very high in Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems and warm-water coral reefs.  • More intense and frequent extreme rainfall and associated flooding in many regions including coastal and other low-lying cities , and increased proportion of and peak wind speeds of intense tropical cyclones.  • High risks from dryland water scarcity, wildfire damage, and permafrost degradation.  • Continued sea level rise and increased frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events encroaching on coastal human settlements and damaging coastal infrastructure , committing low-lying coastal ecosystems to submergence and loss, expanding land salinization, with cascading to risks to livelihoods, health, well-being, cultural values, food and water security.  • Climate change will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths from the near to long term. Further warming will increase climate-sensitive food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne disease risks, and mental health challenges including anxiety and stress.  Cryosphere-related changes in floods, landslides, and water availability have the potential to lead to severe consequences for people, infrastructure and the economy in most mountain regions .  • The projected increase in frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation will increase rain-generated local flooding.  Multiple climate change risks will increasingly compound and cascade in the near term. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming including concurrent heatwaves and drought. Risks to health and food production will be made more severe from the interaction of sudden food production losses from heat and drought, exacerbated by heatinduced labour productivity losses. These interacting impacts will increase food prices, reduce household incomes, and lead to health risks of malnutrition and climate-related mortality with no or low levels of adaptation, especially in tropical regions . Concurrent and cascading risks from climate change to food systems, human settlements, infrastructure and health will make these risks more severe and more difficult to manage, including when interacting with non-climatic risk drivers such as competition for land between urban expansion and food production, and pandemics . Loss of ecosystems and their services has cascading and long-term impacts on people globally, especially for Indigenous Peoples and local communities who are directly dependent on ecosystems, to meet basic needs. Increasing transboundary risks are projected across the food, energy and water sectors as impacts from weather and climate extremes propagate through supply-chains, markets, and natural resource flows and may interact with impacts from other crises such as pandemics. Risks also arise from some responses intended to reduce the risks of climate change, including risks from maladaptation and adverse side effects of some emissions reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures, such as afforestation of naturally unforested land or poorly implemented bioenergy compounding climate-related risks to biodiversity, food and water security, and livelihoods.  With every increment of global warming losses and damages will increase, become increasingly difficult to avoid and be strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations. Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages will be unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries. .
The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible  Change The likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts increase with higher global warming levels. As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems such as forests , coral reefs and in Arctic regions . Risks associated with large-scale singular events or tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from tropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5°C to 2.5°C  and to very high risk between 2.5°C to 4°C. The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations can be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century time scales. The probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds increases with further warming.  Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years . Global mean sea level rise will continue in the 21st century, with projected regional relative sea level rise within 20% of the global mean along two-thirds of the global coastline . The magnitude, the rate, the timing of threshold exceedances, and the long-term commitment of sea level rise depend on emissions, with higher emissions leading to greater and faster rates of sea level rise. Due to relative sea level rise, extreme sea level events that occurred once per century in the recent past are projected to occur at least annually at more than half of all tide gauge locations by 2100 and risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase beyond 2100. At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia. The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global surface temperatures. Over the next 2000 years, global mean sea level will rise by about 2 to 3 m if warming is limited to 1.5°C and 2 to 6 m if limited to 2°C . Projections of multi-millennial global mean sea level rise are consistent with reconstructed levels during past warm climate periods: global mean sea level was very likely 5 to 25 m higher than today roughly 3 million years ago, when global temperatures were 2.5°C to 4°C higher than 1850–1900. Further examples of unavoidable changes in the climate system due to multi-decadal or longer response timescales include continued glacier melt  and permafrost carbon loss.  The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global warming levels. Warming substantially above the assessed very likely range for a given scenario cannot be ruled out, and there is high confidence this would lead to regional changes greater than assessed in many aspects of the climate system. Low-likelihood, high-impact outcomes could occur at regional scales even for global warming within the very likely assessed range for a given GHG emissions scenario. Global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under a very high GHG emissions scenario  – cannot be ruled out due to deep uncertainty in ice-sheet processes 123 and would have severe impacts on populations in low elevation coastal zones. If global warming increases, some compound extreme events 124 will become more frequent, with higher likelihood of unprecedented intensities, durations or spatial extent. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is very likely to weaken over the 21st century for all considered scenarios, however an abrupt collapse is not expected before 2100 . If such a low probability event were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns and water cycle, such as a southward shift in the tropical rain belt, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities. A sequence of large explosive volcanic eruptions within decades, as have occurred in the past, is a low-likelihood high-impact event that would lead to substantial cooling globally and regional climate perturbations over several decades.
Impacts and Related Risks  For a given level of warming, many climate-related risks are assessed to be higher than in AR5. Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern 121 are assessed to become high to very high at lower global warming levels compared to what was assessed in AR5. This is based upon recent evidence of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level of global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to multiple times higher than currently observed for 127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people and species. Risks, including cascading risks and risks from overshoot, are projected to become increasingly severe with every increment of global warming.  Climate-related risks for natural and human systems are higher for global warming of 1.5°C than at present but lower than at 2°C . Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C. In terrestrial ecosystems, 3 to 14% of the tens of thousands of species assessed will likely face a very high risk of extinction at a GWL of 1.5°C. Coral reefs are projected to decline by a further 70–90% at 1.5°C of global warming. At this GWL, many low-elevation and small glaciers around the world would lose most of their mass or disappear within decades to centuries. Regions at disproportionately higher risk include Arctic ecosystems, dryland regions, small island developing states and Least Developed Countries .  At 2°C of global warming, overall risk levels associated with the unequal distribution of impacts, global aggregate impacts and large-scale singular events would be transitioning to high , those associated with extreme weather events would be transitioning to very high, and those associated with unique and threatened systems would be very high  . With about 2°C warming, climate-related changes in food availability and diet quality are estimated to increase nutrition-related diseases and the number of undernourished people, affecting tens to hundreds of millions of people, particularly among low-income households in low- and middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Central America. For example, snowmelt water availability for irrigation is projected to decline in some snowmelt dependent river basins by up to 20% . Climate change risks to cities, settlements and key infrastructure will rise sharply in the mid and long term with further global warming, especially in places already exposed to high temperatures, along coastlines, or with high vulnerabilities .  At global warming of 3°C, additional risks in many sectors and regions reach high or very high levels, implying widespread systemic impacts, irreversible change and many additional adaptation limits . For example, very high extinction risk for endemic species in biodiversity hotspots is projected to increase at least tenfold if warming rises from 1.5°C to 3°C. Projected increases in direct flood damages are higher by 1.4 to 2 times at 2°C and 2.5 to 3.9 times at 3°C, compared to 1.5°C global warming without adaptation.  Global warming of 4°C and above is projected to lead to far-reaching impacts on natural and human systems. Beyond 4°C of warming, projected impacts on natural systems include local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area. At this level of warming, approximately 10% of the global land area is projected to face both increasing high and decreasing low extreme streamflow, affecting, without additional adaptation, over 2.1 billion people and about 4 billion people are projected to experience water scarcity. At 4°C of warming, the global burned area is projected to increase by 50 to 70% and the fire frequency by ~30% compared to today.  Projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages from climate change escalate with every increment of global warming , but they will also strongly depend on socio-economic development trajectories and adaptation actions to reduce vulnerability and exposure. For example, development pathways with higher demand for food, animal feed, and water, more resource-intensive consumption and production, and limited technological improvements result in higher risks from water scarcity in drylands, land degradation and food insecurity . Changes in, for example, demography or investments in health systems have effect on a variety of health-related outcomes including heat-related morbidity and mortality.  With every increment of warming, climate change impacts and risks will become increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Many regions are projected to experience an increase in the probability of compound events with higher global warming, such as concurrent heatwaves and droughts, compound flooding and fire weather. In addition, multiple climatic and non-climatic risk drivers such as biodiversity loss or violent conflict will interact, resulting in compounding overall risk and risks cascading across sectors and regions. Furthermore, risks can arise from some responses that are intended to reduce the risks of climate change, e.g., adverse side effects of some emission reduction and carbon dioxide removal measures .  Solar Radiation Modification approaches, if they were to be implemented, introduce a widespread range of new risks to people and ecosystems, which are not well understood. SRM has the potential to offset warming within one or two decades and ameliorate some climate hazards but would not restore climate to a previous state, and substantial residual or overcompensating climate change would occur at regional and seasonal scales. Effects of SRM would depend on the specific approach used 122, and a sudden and sustained termination of SRM in a high CO 2 emissions scenario would cause rapid climate change. SRM would not stop atmospheric CO 2 concentrations from increasing nor reduce resulting ocean acidification under continued anthropogenic emissions. Large uncertainties and knowledge gaps are associated with the potential of SRM approaches to reduce climate change risks. Lack of robust and formal SRM governance poses risks as deployment by a limited number of states could create international tensions.
Long-term Adaptation Options and Limits  With increasing warming, adaptation options will become more constrained and less effective. At higher levels of warming, losses and damages will increase, and additional human and natural systems will reach adaptation limits. Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. Maladaptation can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks but can be avoided by long-term planning and the implementation of adaptation actions that are flexible, multi-sectoral and inclusive. The effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk is documented for specific contexts, sectors and regions and will decrease with increasing warming 125 . For example, common adaptation responses in agriculture – adopting improved cultivars and agronomic practices, and changes in cropping patterns and crop systems – will become less effective from 2°C to higher levels of warming. The effectiveness of most water-related adaptation options to reduce projected risks declines with increasing warming. Adaptations for hydropower and thermo-electric power generation are effective in most regions up to 1.5°C to 2°C, with decreasing effectiveness at higher levels of warming . Ecosystem-based Adaptation is vulnerable to climate change impacts, with effectiveness declining with increasing global warming. Globally, adaptation options related to agroforestry and forestry have a sharp decline in effectiveness at 3°C, with a substantial increase in residual risk.  With increasing global warming, more limits to adaptation will be reached and losses and damages, strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations, will increase. Already below 1.5°C, autonomous and evolutionary adaptation responses by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will increasingly face hard limits. Above 1.5°C, some ecosystem-based adaptation measures will lose their effectiveness in providing benefits to people as these ecosystems will reach hard adaptation limits. Adaptation to address the risks of heat stress, heat mortality and reduced capacities for outdoor work for humans face soft and hard limits across regions that become significantly more severe at 1.5°C, and are particularly relevant for regions with warm climates. Above 1.5°C global warming level, limited freshwater resources pose potential hard limits for small islands and for regions dependent on glacier and snow melt . By 2°C, soft limits are projected for multiple staple crops, particularly in tropical regions. By 3°C, soft limits are projected for some water management measures for many regions, with hard limits projected for parts of Europe .  Integrated, cross-cutting multi-sectoral solutions increase the effectiveness of adaptation. For example, inclusive, integrated and long-term planning at local, municipal, sub-national and national scales, together with effective regulation and monitoring systems and financial and technological resources and capabilities foster urban and rural system transition. There are a range of cross-cutting adaptation options, such as disaster risk management, early warning systems, climate services and risk spreading and sharing that have broad applicability across sectors and provide greater benefits to other adaptation options when combined. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation, and addressing a range of constraints, primarily in the financial, governance, institutional and policy domains, can help overcome soft adaptation limits. However, adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits.  Maladaptive responses to climate change can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing inequalities. Actions that focus on sectors and risks in isolation and on short-term gains often lead to maladaptation. Adaptation options can become maladaptive due to their environmental impacts that constrain ecosystem services and decrease biodiversity and ecosystem resilience to climate change or by causing adverse outcomes for different groups, exacerbating inequity. Maladaptation can be avoided by flexible, multi-sectoral, inclusive and long-term planning and implementation of adaptation actions with benefits to many sectors and systems.  Sea level rise poses a distinctive and severe adaptation challenge as it implies both dealing with slow onset changes and increases in the frequency and magnitude of extreme sea level events . Such adaptation challenges would occur much earlier under high rates of sea level rise. Responses to ongoing sea level rise and land subsidence include protection, accommodation, advance and planned relocation. These responses are more effective if combined and/or sequenced, planned well ahead, aligned with sociocultural values and underpinned by inclusive community engagement processes. Ecosystem-based solutions such as wetlands provide co-benefits for the environment and climate mitigation, and reduce costs for flood defences , but have site-specific physical limits, at least above 1.5ºC of global warming and lose effectiveness at high rates of sea level rise beyond 0.5 to 1 cm yr -1. Seawalls can be maladaptive as they effectively reduce impacts in the short term but can also result in lock-ins and increase exposure to climate risks in the long term unless they are integrated into a long-term adaptive plan.
The Timing and Urgency of Climate Action  The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions . Global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C between 2021 and 2040 even under the very low GHG emission scenarios, and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios 141. Many adaptation options have medium or high feasibility up to 1.5°C , but hard limits to adaptation have already been reached in some ecosystems and the effectiveness of adaptation to reduce climate risk will decrease with increasing warming. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade determine the extent to which medium- and long-term pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development. Climate resilient development prospects are increasingly limited if current greenhouse gas emissions do not rapidly decline, especially if 1.5°C global warming is exceeded in the near term. Without urgent, effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation actions, climate change increasingly threatens the health and livelihoods of people around the globe, ecosystem health, and biodiversity, with severe adverse consequences for current and future generations. .  In modelled pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot and in those that limit warming to 2°C, assuming immediate actions, global GHG emissions are projected to peak in the early 2020s followed by rapid and deep GHG emissions reductions 142 . In pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net global GHG emissions are projected to fall by 43 [34 to 60]%143 below 2019 levels by 2030, 60 [49 to 77]% by 2035, 69 [58 to 90]% by 2040 and 84 [73 to 98]% by 2050 144. Global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C have reductions in GHG emissions below 2019 levels of 21 [1 to 42]% by 2030, 35 [22 to 55] % by 2035, 46 [34 to 63] % by 2040 and 64 [53 to 77]% by 2050145. Global GHG emissions associated with NDCs announced prior to COP26 would make it likely that warming would exceed 1.5°C and limiting warming to 2°C would then imply a rapid acceleration of emission reductions during 2030–2050, around 70% faster than in pathways where immediate action is taken to limit warming to 2°C Continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would act as barriers to this acceleration and increase feasibility risks.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve reductions in both net CO 2 emissions and non-CO 2 emissions. For example, in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CH4 emissions are reduced by 34 [21 to 57]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 44 [31 to 63]% in 2040. Global CH 4 emissions are reduced by 24 [9 to 53]% below 2019 levels by 2030 and by 37 [20 to 60]% in 2040 in modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C with action starting in 2020.  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve GHG emission reductions in all sectors . The contributions of different sectors vary across modelled mitigation pathways. In most global modelled mitigation pathways, emissions from land-use, land-use change and forestry, via reforestation and reduced deforestation, and from the energy supply sector reach net zero CO2 emissions earlier than the buildings, industry and transport sectors. Strategies can rely on combinations of different options, but doing less in one sector needs to be compensated by further reductions in other sectors if warming is to be limited.  Without rapid, deep and sustained mitigation and accelerated adaptation actions, losses and damages will continue to increase, including projected adverse impacts in Africa, LDCs, SIDS, Central and South America , Asia and the Arctic, and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable populations .  
Benefits of Strengthening Near-Term Action  Accelerated implementation of adaptation will improve well-being by reducing losses and damages, especially for vulnerable populations. Deep, rapid, and sustained mitigation actions would reduce future adaptation costs and losses and damages, enhance sustainable development co-benefits, avoid locking-in emission sources, and reduce stranded assets and irreversible climate changes. These near-term actions involve higher up-front investments and disruptive changes, which can be moderated by a range of enabling conditions and removal or reduction of barriers to feasibility. Accelerated implementation of adaptation responses will bring benefits to human well-being. As adaptation options often have long implementation times, long-term planning and accelerated implementation, particularly in this decade, is important to close adaptation gaps, recognising that constraints remain for some regions. The benefits to vulnerable populations would be high .  Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, compared to higher warming levels, but cannot eliminate them all . The magnitude and rate of climate change and associated risks depend strongly on near-term mitigation and adaptation actions, and projected adverse impacts and related losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming. Delayed mitigation action will further increase global warming which will decrease the effectiveness of many adaptation options, including Ecosystem-based Adaptation and many water-related options, as well as increasing mitigation feasibility risks, such as for options based on ecosystems. Comprehensive, effective, and innovative responses integrating adaptation and mitigation can harness synergies and reduce trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation, as well as in meeting requirements for financing .  Mitigation actions will have other sustainable development co-benefits. Mitigation will improve air quality and human health in the near term notably because many air pollutants are co-emitted by GHG emitting sectors and because methane emissions leads to surface ozone formation. The benefits from air quality improvement include prevention of air pollution-related premature deaths, chronic diseases and damages to ecosystems and crops. The economic benefits for human health from air quality improvement arising from mitigation action can be of the same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially even larger . As methane has a short lifetime but is a potent GHG, strong, rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions can limit near-term warming and improve air quality by reducing global surface ozone.  Challenges from delayed adaptation and mitigation actions include the risk of cost escalation, lock-in of infrastructure, stranded assets, and reduced feasibility and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options. The continued installation of unabated fossil fuel infrastructure will ‘lock-in’ GHG emissions. Limiting global warming to 2°C or below will leave a substantial amount of fossil fuels unburned and could strand considerable fossil fuel infrastructure , with globally discounted value projected to be around USD 1 to 4 trillion from 2015 to 2050. Early actions would limit the size of these stranded assets, whereas delayed actions with continued investments in unabated high-emitting infrastructure and limited development and deployment of low-emitting alternatives prior to 2030 would raise future stranded assets to the higher end of the range – thereby acting as barriers and increasing political economy feasibility risks that may jeopardise efforts to limit global warming. .  Scaling-up near-term climate actions will mobilise a mix of low-cost and high-cost options. High-cost options, as in energy and infrastructure, are needed to avoid future lock-ins, foster innovation and initiate transformational changes. Climate resilient development pathways in support of sustainable development for all are shaped by equity, and social and climate justice. Embedding effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation in development planning can reduce vulnerability, conserve and restore ecosystems, and enable climate resilient development. This is especially challenging in localities with persistent development gaps and limited resources.  Scaling-up climate action may generate disruptive changes in economic structure with distributional consequences and need to reconcile divergent interests, values and worldviews, within and between countries. Deeper fiscal, financial, institutional and regulatory reforms can offset such adverse effects and unlock mitigation potentials. Societal choices and actions implemented in this decade will determine the extent to which medium and long-term development pathways will deliver higher or lower climate resilient development outcomes.  Enabling conditions would need to be strengthened in the nearterm and barriers reduced or removed to realise opportunities for deep and rapid adaptation and mitigation actions and climate resilient development. These enabling conditions are differentiated by national, regional and local circumstances and geographies, according to capabilities, and include: equity and inclusion in climate action, rapid and far-reaching transitions in sectors and system , measures to achieve synergies and reduce tradeoffs with sustainable development goals, governance and policy improvements, access to finance, improved international cooperation and technology improvements, and integration of near-term actions across sectors, systems and regions.  Barriers to feasibility would need to be reduced or removed to deploy mitigation and adaptation options at scale. Many limits to feasibility and effectiveness of responses can be overcome by addressing a range of barriers, including economic, technological, institutional, social, environmental and geophysical barriers. The feasibility and effectiveness of options increase with integrated, multi-sectoral solutions that differentiate responses based on climate risk, cut across systems and address social inequities. Strengthened near-term actions in modelled cost-effective pathways that limit global warming to 2°C or lower, reduce the overall risk to the feasibility of the system transitions, compared to modelled pathways with delayed or uncoordinated action.  Integrating ambitious climate actions with macroeconomic policies under global uncertainty would provide benefits . This encompasses three main directions: economy-wide mainstreaming packages supporting options to improved sustainable low-emission economic recovery, development and job creation programs  safety nets and social protection in the transition; and broadened access to finance, technology and capacity-building and coordinated support to low-emission infrastructure , especially in developing regions, and under debt stress .
Adaptation Gaps and Barriers  Despite progress, adaptation gaps exist between current levels of adaptation and levels needed to respond to impacts and reduce climate risks. While progress in adaptation implementation is observed across all sectors and regions , many adaptation initiatives prioritise immediate and near-term climate risk reduction, e.g., through hard flood protection, which reduces the opportunity for transformational adaptation . Most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, incremental, sector-specific, and focused more on planning rather than implementation. Further, observed adaptation is unequally distributed across regions and the largest adaptation gaps exist among lower population income groups. In the urban context, the largest adaptation gaps exist in projects that manage complex risks, for example in the food–energy–water–health nexus or the inter-relationships of air quality and climate risk. Many funding, knowledge and practice gaps remain for effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation and current adaptation efforts are not expected to meet existing goals. At current rates of adaptation planning and implementation the adaptation gap will continue to grow.  Soft and hard adaptation limits 100 have already been reached in some sectors and regions, in spite of adaptation having buffered some climate impacts. Ecosystems already reaching hard adaptation limits include some warm water coral reefs, some coastal wetlands, some rainforests, and some polar and mountain ecosystems. Individuals and households in low lying coastal areas in Australasia and Small Islands and smallholder farmers in Central and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia have reached soft limits, resulting from financial, governance, institutional and policy constraints and can be overcome by addressing these constraints. Transitioning from incremental to transformational adaptation can help overcome soft adaptation limits .  Adaptation does not prevent all losses and damages, even with effective adaptation and before reaching soft and hard limits. Losses and damages are unequally distributed across systems, regions and sectors and are not comprehensively addressed by current financial, governance and institutional arrangements, particularly in vulnerable developing countries.  There is increased evidence of maladaptation in various sectors and regions. Examples of maladaptation are observed in urban areas , agriculture , ecosystems (e.g. fire suppression in naturally
Remaining Carbon Budgets  Limiting global temperature increase to a specific level requires limiting cumulative net CO2 emissions to within a finite carbon budget , along with strong reductions in other GHGs. For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global mean temperature rises by likely 0.27°C to 0.63°C. This relationship implies that there is a finite carbon budget that cannot be exceeded in order to limit warming to any given level.  The best estimates of the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood is estimated to be 500 GtCO2; for 2°C this is 1150 GtCO2.128 Remaining carbon budgets have been quantified based on the assessed value of TCRE and its uncertainty, estimates of historical warming, climate system feedbacks such as emissions from thawing permafrost, and the global surface temperature change after global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions reach net zero, as well as variations in projected warming from non-CO2 emissions due in part to mitigation action. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given RCB or the larger RCB for the same level of temperature change. For instance, the RCB for limiting warming to 1.5°C with a 50% likelihood could vary between 300 to 600 GtCO 2 depending on non-CO 2 warming 129 . Limiting warming to 2°C with a 67% likelihood would imply a RCB of 1150 GtCO2 from the beginning of 2020. To stay below 2°C with a 50% likelihood, the RCB is higher, i.e., 1350 GtCO 2 If the annual CO2 emissions between 2020–2030 stayed, on average, at the same level as 2019, the resulting cumulative emissions would almost exhaust the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C, and exhaust more than a third of the remaining carbon budget for 2°C . Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2019 amount to about four-fifths of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and to about two-thirds of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2°C.  In scenarios with increasing CO 2 emissions, the land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to be less effective at slowing the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. While natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up, in absolute terms, a progressively larger amount of CO 2 under higher compared to lower CO2 emissions scenarios, they become less effective, that is, the proportion of emissions taken up by land and ocean decreases with increasing cumulative net CO2 emissions. Additional ecosystem responses to warming not yet fully included in climate models, such as GHG fluxes from wetlands, permafrost thaw, and wildfires, would further increase concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere . In scenarios where CO2 concentrations peak and decline during the 21st century, the land and ocean begin to take up less carbon in response to declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations  and turn into a weak net source by 2100 in the very low GHG emissions scenario 133.
Net Zero Emissions: Timing and Implications  From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions, reaching net zero or net negative CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions of other GHG emissions . Global modelled pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature. Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative CO2 emissions.134 Carbon dioxide removal will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 emissions 135. Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions, with remaining anthropogenic CO 2 emissions balanced by durably stored CO 2 from anthropogenic removal, is a requirement to stabilise CO2-induced global surface temperature increase . This is different from achieving net zero GHG emissions, where metric-weighted anthropogenic GHG emissions  equal CO 2 removal. Emissions pathways that reach and sustain net zero GHG emissions defined by the 100-year global warming potential imply net negative CO2 emissions and are projected to result in a gradual decline in surface temperature after an earlier peak. While reaching net zero CO2 or net zero GHG emissions requires deep and rapid reductions in gross emissions, the deployment of CDR to counterbalance hardto-abate residual emissions  is unavoidable .  In modelled pathways, the timing of net zero CO2 emissions, followed by net zero GHG emissions, depends on several variables, including the desired climate outcome, the mitigation strategy and the gases covered. Global net zero CO2 emissions are reached in the early 2050s in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, and around the early 2070s in pathways that limit warming to 2°C. While non-CO2 GHG emissions are strongly reduced in all pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower, residual emissions of CH4 and N2O and F-gases of about 8 [5–11] GtCO2 -eq yr -1 remain at the time of net zero GHG, counterbalanced by net negative CO2 emissions. As a result, net zero CO2 would be reached before net zero GHGs .
Sectoral Contributions to Mitigation  All global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 involve rapid and deep and in most cases immediate GHG emissions reductions in all sectors. Reductions in GHG emissions in industry, transport, buildings, and urban areas can be achieved through a combination of energy efficiency and conservation and a transition to low-GHG technologies and energy carriers. Socio-cultural options and behavioural change can reduce global GHG emissions of end-use sectors, with most of the potential in developed countries, if combined with improved infrastructure design and access.  Global modelled mitigation pathways reaching net zero CO2 and GHG emissions include transitioning from fossil fuels without carbon capture and storage to very low- or zero-carbon energy sources, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CCS, demand-side measures and improving efficiency, reducing non-CO2 GHG emissions, and CDR 136. In global modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or below, almost all electricity is supplied from zero or low-carbon sources in 2050, such as renewables or fossil fuels with CO2 capture and storage, combined with increased electrification of energy demand. Such pathways meet energy service demand with relatively low energy use, through e.g., enhanced energy efficiency and behavioural changes and increased electrification of energy end use. Modelled global pathways limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot generally implement such changes faster than pathways limiting global warming to 2°C.  AFOLU mitigation options, when sustainably implemented, can deliver large-scale GHG emission reductions and enhanced CO2 removal; however, barriers to implementation and trade-offs may result from the impacts of climate change, competing demands on land, conflicts with food security and livelihoods, the complexity of land ownership and management systems, and cultural aspects. All assessed modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C or lower by 2100 include land-based mitigation and land-use change, with most including different combinations of reforestation, afforestation, reduced deforestation, and bioenergy. However, accumulated carbon in vegetation and soils is at risk from future loss triggered by climate change and disturbances such as flood, drought, fire, or pest outbreaks, or future poor management.  In addition to deep, rapid, and sustained emission reductions, CDR can fulfil three complementary roles: lowering net CO2 or net GHG emissions in the near term; counterbalancing ‘hard-to-abate’ residual emissions  to help reach net zero CO2 or GHG emissions, and achieving net negative CO 2 or GHG emissions if deployed at levels exceeding annual residual emissions. CDR methods vary in terms of their maturity, removal process, time scale of carbon storage, storage medium, mitigation potential, cost, co-benefits, impacts and risks, and governance requirements. Specifically, maturity ranges from lower maturity to higher maturity; removal and storage potential ranges from lower potential to higher potential; costs range from lower cost to higher cost  . Estimated storage timescales vary from decades to centuries for methods that store carbon in vegetation and through soil carbon management, to ten thousand years or more for methods that store carbon in geological formations . Afforestation, reforestation, improved forest management, agroforestry and soil carbon sequestration are currently the only widely practiced CDR methods. Methods and levels of CDR deployment in global modelled mitigation pathways vary depending on assumptions about costs, availability and constraints.
The Gap Between Mitigation Policies, Pledges and  Pathways that Limit Warming to 1.5°C or Below 2°C Global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP2691 would make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century and would make it harder to limit warming below 2°C – if no additional commitments are made or actions taken. A substantial ‘emissions gap’ exists as global GHG emissions in 2030 associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 would be similar to or only slightly below 2019 emission levels and higher than those associated with modelled mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot or to 2°C, assuming immediate action, which implies deep, rapid, and sustained global GHG emission reductions this decade  . 92 The magnitude of the emissions gap depends on the global warming level considered and whether only unconditional or also conditional elements of NDCs 93 are considered . Modelled pathways that are consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no increase in ambition thereafter have higher emissions, leading to a median global warming of 2.8 [2.1 to 3.4]°C by 2100 . If the ‘emission gap’ is not reduced, global GHG emissions in 2030 consistent with NDCs announced prior to COP26 make it likely that warming will exceed 1.5°C during the 21st century, while limiting warming to 2°C would imply an unprecedented acceleration of mitigation efforts during 2030–2050 .  Policies implemented by the end of 2020 are projected to result in higher global GHG emissions in 2030 than those implied by NDCs, indicating an ‘implementation gap 94 ’ . Projected global emissions implied by policies implemented by the end of 2020 are 57 GtCO2 -eq in 2030. This points to an implementation gap compared with the NDCs of 4 to 7 GtCO 2-eq in 2030; without a strengthening of policies, emissions are projected to rise, leading to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 .  Projected cumulative future CO2 emissions over the lifetime of existing fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement exceed the total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. They are approximately equal to total cumulative net CO2 emissions in pathways that limit warming to 2°C with a likelihood of 83% 96. Limiting warming to 2°C or lower will result in stranded assets. About 80% of coal, 50% of gas, and 30% of oil reserves cannot be burned and emitted if warming is limited to 2°C. Significantly more reserves are expected to remain unburned if warming is limited to 1.5°C.  Many countries have signalled an intention to achieve net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions by around mid-century . More than 100 countries have either adopted, announced or are discussing net zero GHG or net zero CO 2 emissions commitments, covering more than two-thirds of global GHG emissions. A growing number of cities are setting climate targets, including net zero GHG targets. Many companies and institutions have also announced net zero emissions targets in recent years. The various net zero emission pledges differ across countries in terms of scope and specificity, and limited policies are to date in place to deliver on them.  All mitigation strategies face implementation challenges, including technology risks, scaling, and costs. Almost all mitigation options also face institutional barriers that need to be addressed to enable their application at scale . Current development pathways may create behavioural, spatial, economic and social barriers to accelerated mitigation at all scales. Choices made by policymakers, citizens, the private sector and other stakeholders influence societies’ development pathways. Structural factors of national circumstances and capabilities  affect the breadth and depth of climate governance. The extent to which civil society actors, political actors, businesses, youth, labour, media, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities are engaged influences political support for climate change mitigation and eventual policy outcomes.  The adoption of low-emission technologies lags in most developing countries, particularly least developed ones, due in part to weaker enabling conditions, including limited finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity . In many countries, especially those with limited institutional capacity, several adverse side-effects have been observed as a result of diffusion of low-emission technology, e.g., low-value employment, and dependency on foreign knowledge and suppliers. Low-emission innovation along with strengthened enabling conditions can reinforce development benefits, which can, in turn, create feedbacks towards greater public support for policy. Persistent and region-specific barriers also continue to hamper the economic and political feasibility of deploying AFOLU mitigation options. Barriers to implementation of AFOLU mitigation include insufficient institutional and financial support, uncertainty over long-term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, insecure land ownership, low incomes and the lack of access to alternative sources of income, and the risk of reversal .
Near-Term Mitigation and Adaptation Actions  Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep and sustained emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. These system transitions involve a significant upscaling of a wide portfolio of mitigation and adaptation options. Feasible, effective and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available, with differences across systems and regions.  Rapid and far-reaching transitions across all sectors and systems are necessary to achieve deep emissions reductions and secure a liveable and sustainable future for all. System transitions consistent with pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot are more rapid and pronounced in the near-term than in those that limit warming to 2°C . Such a systemic change is unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in terms of speed. The system transitions make possible the transformative adaptation required for high levels of human health and well-being, economic and social resilience, ecosystem health, and planetary health.  Feasible, effective and low-cost options for mitigation and adaptation are already available. Mitigation options costing USD 100 tCO 2-eq–1 or less could reduce global GHG emissions by at least half the 2019 level by 2030  . The availability, feasibility 152 and potential of mitigation or effectiveness of adaptation options in the near term differ across systems and regions.  Demand-side measures and new ways of end-use service provision can reduce global GHG emissions in end-use sectors by 40 to 70% by 2050 compared to baseline scenarios, while some regions and socioeconomic groups require additional energy and resources. Demand-side mitigation encompasses changes in infrastructure use, end-use technology adoption, and socio-cultural and behavioural change. .
Synergies and trade-offs, costs and benefits  Mitigation and adaptation options can lead to synergies and trade-offs with other aspects of sustainable development . Synergies and trade-offs depend on the pace and magnitude of changes and the development context including inequalities, with consideration of climate justice. The potential or effectiveness of some adaptation and mitigation options decreases as climate change intensifies .  In the energy sector, transitions to low-emission systems will have multiple co-benefits, including improvements in air quality and health. There are potential synergies between sustainable development and, for instance, energy efficiency and renewable energy.  For agriculture, land, and food systems, many land management options and demand-side response options  can contribute to eradicating poverty and eliminating hunger while promoting good health and well-being, clean water and sanitation, and life on land . In contrast, certain adaptation options that promote intensification of production, such as irrigation, may have negative effects on sustainability  .  Reforestation, improved forest management, soil carbon sequestration, peatland restoration and coastal blue carbon management are examples of CDR methods that can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions, employment and local livelihoods, depending on context . However, afforestation or production of biomass crops for bioenergy with carbon dioxide capture and storage or biochar can have adverse socio-economic and environmental impacts, including on biodiversity, food and water security, local livelihoods and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, especially if implemented at large scales and where land tenure is insecure.  Modelled pathways that assume using resources more efficiently or shift global development towards sustainability include fewer challenges, such as dependence on CDR and pressure on land and biodiversity, and have the most pronounced synergies with respect to sustainable development .  Strengthening climate change mitigation action entails more rapid transitions and higher up-front investments, but brings benefits from avoiding damages from climate change and reduced adaptation costs. The aggregate effects of climate change mitigation on global GDP  are small compared to global projected GDP growth. Projected estimates of global aggregate net economic damages and the costs of adaptation generally increase with global warming level.  Cost-benefit analysis remains limited in its ability to represent all damages from climate change, including non-monetary damages, or to capture the heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic damages. Even without accounting for these factors or for the co-benefits of mitigation, the global benefits of limiting warming to 2°C exceed the cost of mitigation . This finding is robust against a wide range of assumptions about social preferences on inequalities and discounting over time . Limiting global warming to 1.5°C instead of 2°C would increase the costs of mitigation, but also increase the benefits in terms of reduced impacts and related risks and reduced adaptation needs 140.  Considering other sustainable development dimensions, such as the potentially strong economic benefits on human health from air quality improvement, may enhance the estimated benefits of mitigation . The economic effects of strengthened mitigation action vary across regions and countries, depending notably on economic structure, regional emissions reductions, policy design and level of international cooperation. Ambitious mitigation pathways imply large and sometimes disruptive changes in economic structure, with implications for near-term actions, equity , sustainability, and finance .
