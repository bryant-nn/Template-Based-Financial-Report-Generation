If CO2 emissions continue at current levels, global warming could reach approximately 3.2°C by 2100, leading to significant sea level rise, potentially approaching 2 meters, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heavy precipitation, flooding, and tropical cyclones. These changes would severely impact coastal and low-lying areas, leading to submergence and loss of ecosystems, expanded land salinization, and cascading risks to livelihoods, health, and food and water security. Biodiversity loss is expected, with potential local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area. Approximately 4 billion people could face water scarcity, and the global burned area may increase by 50-70%, with a ~30% rise in fire frequency.

These effects are compounded by socio-economic factors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive adaptation and mitigation strategies.\n\nThe reasoning behind these projections is based on the expected increase in the intensity and frequency of climate hazards as global temperatures rise.

Biodiversity will face increased risks, particularly in forest ecosystems, kelp and seagrass ecosystems, Arctic sea-ice and terrestrial ecosystems, and warm-water coral reefs, due to more frequent and intense marine heatwaves and extreme weather events. Water resources will become more strained as the effectiveness of water-related adaptation options declines with rising temperatures, leading to increased transboundary risks across food, energy, and water sectors. Agriculture will experience reduced effectiveness of adaptation strategies, such as changes in cropping patterns and agronomic practices, especially as warming exceeds 2°C, resulting in increased losses and damages, particularly among the poorest and most vulnerable populations."

      "summary": "The likelihood of overshooting critical climate warming thresholds is influenced by current emission trends, which, if not reduced rapidly, increase the risk of surpassing the 1.5°C target. Overshoot scenarios necessitate substantial net negative CO2 emissions to mitigate temperature exceedance, with higher overshoot levels leading to more severe and irreversible impacts on ecosystems and societies. Mitigation actions, such as rapid and sustained emissions reductions across all sectors, reducing short-lived climate forcers like methane, and achieving net negative emissions, are crucial to minimize overshoot risks and limit adverse consequences.\n\nIn summary, the probability of exceeding critical warming thresholds is heightened by ongoing emissions, which strain the remaining carbon budget. Effective mitigation strategies, including deep emissions cuts and enhanced carbon removal efforts, are essential to prevent or limit overshoot and its associated impacts.",

            "The Likelihood and Risks of Abrupt and Irreversible  Change The likelihood of abrupt and irreversible changes and their impacts increase with higher global warming levels. As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems such as forests , coral reefs and in Arctic regions . Risks associated with large-scale singular events or tipping points, such as ice sheet instability or ecosystem loss from tropical forests, transition to high risk between 1.5°C to 2.5°C  and to very high risk between 2.5°C to 4°C. The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations can be abrupt at regional scales and irreversible on decadal to century time scales. The probability of crossing uncertain regional thresholds increases with further warming.  Sea level rise is unavoidable for centuries to millennia due to continuing deep ocean warming and ice sheet melt, and sea levels will remain elevated for thousands of years .",

Levels of risk for all Reasons for Concern 121 are assessed to become high to very high at lower global warming levels compared to what was assessed in AR5. This is based upon recent evidence of observed impacts, improved process understanding, and new knowledge on exposure and vulnerability of human and natural systems, including limits to adaptation. Depending on the level of global warming, the assessed long-term impacts will be up to multiple times higher than currently observed for 127 identified key risks, e.g., in terms of the number of affected people and species. Risks, including cascading risks and risks from overshoot, are projected to become increasingly severe with every increment of global warming.

Those modulations are important to consider in adaptation planning. Global surface temperature in any single year can vary above or below the long-term human-induced trend, due to natural variability. By 2030, global surface temperature in any individual year could exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850–1900 with a probability between 40% and 60%, across the five scenarios assessed in WGI.

Achieving this involves removing more CO2 from the atmosphere than emitted, using strategies like carbon capture and storage (CCS), direct air capture (DAC), afforestation, and reducing short-lived climate forcers like methane. The feasibility of returning depends on the magnitude of the overshoot and the speed of implementing these measures, with pathways requiring 220 to 360 GtCO2 of cumulative net negative emissions by 2100.
