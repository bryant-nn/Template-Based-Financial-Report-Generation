        "Reference Summary": "From a physical science perspective, limiting human-caused global warming to a specific level requires limiting cumulative  CO2 emissions, reaching at least net zero CO2 emissions, along with strong reductions in other greenhouse gas emissions. Reaching net zero GHG emissions primarily requires deep reductions in CO2, methane, and other GHG emissions, and implies net negative CO2 emissions. Carbon dioxide removal will be necessary to achieve net negative CO2 emissions. Net zero GHG emissions, if sustained, are projected to result in a gradual decline in global surface temperatures after an earlier peak. For every 1000 GtCO2 emitted by human activity, global surface temperature rises by 0.45°C . The best estimates of the remaining carbon budgets from the beginning of 2020 are 500 GtCO2 for a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO2 for a 67% likelihood of limiting warming to 2°C40. The stronger the reductions in non-CO2 emissions, the lower the resulting temperatures are for a given remaining carbon budget or the larger remaining carbon budget for the same level of temperature change.",
        "Generated Summary": "Limiting CO2 emissions is essential for stabilizing global temperatures and achieving climate goals. Scientifically, it controls global warming by reducing cumulative CO2 levels. Environmentally, it prevents irreversible damage and improves air quality, reducing global surface ozone levels. Economically, the benefits of limiting warming to 2°C outweigh mitigation costs, avoiding cost escalations and stranded assets. Additionally, reducing CO2 emissions enhances human health by improving air quality, preventing pollution-related diseases, and benefiting ecosystems. These actions also reduce the need for net negative emissions, mitigating associated risks.",

If CO2 emissions continue at current levels, global warming could reach approximately 3.2°C by 2100, leading to significant sea level rise, potentially approaching 2 meters, and increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heavy precipitation, flooding, and tropical cyclones. These changes would severely impact coastal and low-lying areas, leading to submergence and loss of ecosystems, expanded land salinization, and cascading risks to livelihoods, health, and food and water security. Biodiversity loss is expected, with potential local extinction of ~50% of tropical marine species and biome shifts across 35% of global land area. Approximately 4 billion people could face water scarcity, and the global burned area may increase by 50-70%, with a ~30% rise in fire frequency. Health impacts include increased climate-sensitive diseases and mental health challenges. These effects are compounded by socio-economic factors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive adaptation and mitigation strategies.\n\nThe reasoning behind these projections is based on the expected increase in the intensity and frequency of climate hazards as global temperatures rise. Ecosystems and human societies face heightened risks, with vulnerable populations disproportionately affected.

An intermediate GHG emissions scenario suggests warming of 2.7°C (range: 2.1 to 3.5°C), while a very high GHG emissions scenario projects warming of 4.4°C (range: 3.3 to 5.7°C).

In the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term. Global warming declines back to below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways. The assessed climate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range from 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario 30, with narrower uncertainty ranges than for corresponding scenarios in AR5. Discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios  would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years. Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air quality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions reductions. Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years compared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions. Continued emissions will further affect all major climate system components. With every additional increment of global  warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger. Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation, and very wet and very dry weather and climate events and seasons. In scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up a decreasing proportion of these emissions. Other projected changes include further reduced extents and/or volumes of almost all cryospheric elements, further global mean sea level rise, and increased ocean acidification and deoxygenation .",
        "Generated Summary": "The global warming projections for the period 2081-2100, relative to 1850–1900, vary based on different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios. Under a very low GHG emissions scenario, warming is projected at 1.4°C (range: 1.0 to 1.8°C). An intermediate GHG emissions scenario suggests warming of 2.7°C (range: 2.1 to 3.5°C), while a very high GHG emissions scenario projects warming of 4.4°C (range: 3.3 to 5.7°C). Current policies, as of 2020, could lead to a warming of 3.2°C (range: 2.2 to 3.5°C) by 2100. If climate sensitivity or carbon cycle feedbacks are higher than estimated, warming could exceed 4°C by 2100.\n\n**Explanation**: The projections are based on varying emission scenarios, reflecting uncertainties in future GHG emissions and climate response. These scenarios illustrate potential temperature increases depending on emission levels, with projections refined through improved climate models and observational data. Uncertainties remain, especially concerning ice-sheet processes, which could lead to outcomes exceeding current projections. Regional impacts are expected to be more severe than global trends, with intensified weather events and significant variations in different regions.",

Deep, rapid, and sustained GHG emissions reductions, reaching net zero CO2 emissions and including strong emissions reductions of other GHGs, in particular CH4, are necessary to limit warming to 1.5°C or less than 2°C by the end of century . The best estimate of reaching 1.5°C of global warming lies in the first half of the 2030s in most of the considered scenarios and modelled pathways 114. In the very low GHG emissions scenario, CO 2 emissions reach net zero around 2050 and the best-estimate end-of-century warming is 1.4°C, after a temporary overshoot of no more than 0.1°C above 1.5°C global warming. Global warming of 2°C will be exceeded during the 21st century unless deep reductions in CO 2 and other GHG emissions occur in the coming decades.

Achieving this involves removing more CO2 from the atmosphere than emitted, using strategies like carbon capture and storage (CCS), direct air capture (DAC), afforestation, and reducing short-lived climate forcers like methane. The feasibility of returning depends on the magnitude of the overshoot and the speed of implementing these measures, with pathways requiring 220 to 360 GtCO2 of cumulative net negative emissions by 2100.
