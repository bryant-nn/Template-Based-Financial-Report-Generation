Future exposure to climatic hazards is increasing globally due to socio-economic development trends including migration, growing inequality and urbanisation.

In the near term, global warming is more likely than not to reach 1.5°C even under the very low GHG emission scenario and likely or very likely to exceed 1.5°C under higher emissions scenarios. In the considered scenarios and modelled pathways, the best estimates of the time when the level of global warming of 1.5°C is reached lie in the near term. Global warming declines back to below 1.5°C by the end of the 21st century in some scenarios and modelled pathways. The assessed climate response to GHG emissions scenarios results in a best estimate of warming for 2081–2100 that spans a range from 1.4°C for a very low GHG emissions scenario to 2.7°C for an intermediate GHG emissions scenario and 4.4°C for a very high GHG emissions scenario 30, with narrower uncertainty ranges than for corresponding scenarios in AR5. Discernible differences in trends of global surface temperature between contrasting GHG emissions scenarios  would begin to emerge from natural variability within around 20 years. Under these contrasting scenarios, discernible effects would emerge within years for GHG concentrations, and sooner for air quality improvements, due to the combined targeted air pollution controls and strong and sustained methane emissions reductions. Targeted reductions of air pollutant emissions lead to more rapid improvements in air quality within years compared to reductions in GHG emissions only, but in the long term, further improvements are projected in scenarios that combine efforts to reduce air pollutants as well as GHG emissions. Continued emissions will further affect all major climate system components. With every additional increment of global  warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger. Continued global warming is projected to further intensify the global water cycle, including its variability, global monsoon precipitation, and very wet and very dry weather and climate events and seasons. In scenarios with increasing CO2 emissions, natural land and ocean carbon sinks are projected to take up a decreasing proportion of these emissions. Other projected changes include further reduced extents and/or volumes of almost all cryospheric elements, further global mean sea level rise, and increased ocean acidification and deoxygenation .",

As warming levels increase, so do the risks of species extinction or irreversible loss of biodiversity in ecosystems including forests, coral reefs and in Arctic regions. At sustained warming levels between 2°C and 3°C, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will be lost almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia, causing several metres of sea level rise. The probability and rate of ice mass loss increase with higher global surface temperatures. The probability of low-likelihood outcomes associated with potentially very large impacts increases with higher global  warming levels. Due to deep uncertainty linked to ice-sheet processes, global mean sea level rise above the likely range – approaching 2 m by 2100 and in excess of 15 m by 2300 under the very high GHG emissions scenario  – cannot be excluded. There is medium confidence that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation will not collapse abruptly before 2100, but if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns, and large impacts on ecosystems and human activities.",
