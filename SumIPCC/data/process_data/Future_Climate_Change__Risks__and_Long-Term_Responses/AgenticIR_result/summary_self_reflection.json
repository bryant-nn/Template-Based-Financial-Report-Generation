    "sub section 1.1": "The decrease in effectiveness of adaptation strategies is influenced by several interrelated factors. Financial constraints limit the implementation of necessary measures, with developing countries facing an annual funding gap of approximately $70 billion. Weak governance structures and inadequate policy frameworks can also impede effective adaptation. Furthermore, increasing levels of global warming make some adaptation options less effective; for instance, at 2°C of warming, the effectiveness of common agricultural adaptations is projected to diminish significantly, leading to increased food insecurity. Maladaptation occurs when poorly planned efforts increase vulnerability, such as urban developments that ignore flood risks. Isolation of sectors in adaptation planning can lead to ineffective strategies, undermining overall resilience. Unequal distribution of climate impacts further exacerbates the challenges faced by marginalized communities."
  },
  {
    "sub section 1.2": "Key physical, ecological, and socio-economic limits to adaptation include physical limits faced by ecosystems that can no longer provide essential services and hard ecological limits where biodiversity is at risk, particularly with projections indicating that 30% of species may face extinction if global temperatures rise by 2°C. Socio-economic limits arise from financial, governance, and institutional constraints, particularly in developing regions where adaptation is most necessary. Maladaptation often increases vulnerability, leading to cycles of risk and exacerbating inequalities. As noted, up to 1 million species could face extinction due to climate change, especially if temperatures rise beyond critical levels, which highlights the interconnectedness of these limits and the urgent need for comprehensive adaptation strategies."
  },
  {
    "sub section 1.3": "Examples of maladaptation include urban development practices that create flood defenses without considering ecosystem impacts, resulting in increased flooding incidences. Agricultural practices, such as reliance on crop varieties not suited to changing conditions, can lead to reduced yields. Fire suppression in ecosystems can exacerbate wildfires. The consequences of maladaptation can increase community vulnerability, worsen existing social inequalities, and reduce ecosystem resilience. If changes are not addressed, reliance on ineffective practices may lead to significant long-term economic costs and ecological degradation."

    "sub section 2.1": "The projected climate impacts of not limiting CO2 emissions are severe, with atmospheric CO2 levels currently at around 410 ppm. Continuing emissions at 2019 levels could exhaust the remaining carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5°C and significantly deplete that for 2°C by the end of the century. Consequently, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and threats to biodiversity are expected outcomes, where failure to limit emissions might lead to catastrophic ecological and societal disruptions."

    "sub section 2.2": "Limiting CO2 emissions presents many benefits: improved public health through better air quality could prevent approximately 7 million premature deaths annually. Climate stability can be achieved by adhering to temperature targets, avoiding severe impacts such as loss of biodiversity and extreme weather events. Economically, the transition to a low-carbon economy could generate millions of jobs while enhancing resilience against climate impacts."

  {
    "sub section 3.1": "The primary climate hazards associated with climate change include increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves, projected to rise by up to 50% by 2050, which poses risks to human health and productivity. Marine heatwaves threaten biodiversity and ecosystems in marine environments, while extreme rainfall events are expected to see a 20% increase by 2050, causing flooding, particularly affecting coastal and low-lying areas."

  {
    "sub section 3.2": "The key risks associated with climate change encompass severe economic losses from disaster events, food security challenges stemming from reduced agricultural yields, and social displacement due to extreme weather. The costs associated with disaster response and recovery are rising, necessitating strategic planning to mitigate these impacts on vulnerable populations."

    "sub section 5.1": "Evidence suggests that certain changes are unavoidable, such as reaching 1.5°C of warming by 2028. Increased risks of biodiversity loss and extinction are prevalent, particularly in vulnerable ecosystems, with approximately 30% of species at risk under higher warming scenarios."
