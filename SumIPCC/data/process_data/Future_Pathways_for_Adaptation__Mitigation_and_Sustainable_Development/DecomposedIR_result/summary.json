Sector-specific policies, while potentially less cost-effective than economy-wide policies, are often more practical due to administrative and political barriers. These policies can effectively address sector-specific barriers and market failures. Mechanisms like carbon pricing, including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes, aim for cost-effective mitigation but show diverse effects based on national circumstances and policy design. Loose caps in cap and trade systems have limited short-run environmental impacts. Tax-based policies and regulatory measures, such as energy efficiency standards, are widely used and often environmentally effective.\n\nMitigation policies can devalue fossil fuel assets and reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters, particularly affecting coal and oil trade. The impact on natural gas revenues is less certain. The deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology could mitigate some negative impacts on fossil fuel asset values. Additionally, interactions between policies can be synergistic, such as a carbon tax complementing renewable energy subsidies, or neutral, depending on the policy design and implementation."

Warming caused by CO2 emissions is effectively irreversible over multi-century timescales unless measures are taken to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Ensuring CO2-induced warming remains likely less than 2°C requires cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources to remain below about 3650 GtCO2, over half of which were already emitted by 2011.  Multi-model results show that limiting total human-induced warming to less than 2°C relative to the period 1861–1880 with a probability of >66% would require total CO2"

The estimated total fossil carbon reserves exceed the remaining allowable emissions—needed to stay below a 2°C increase—by a factor of 4 to 7. This indicates that reliance on fossil fuels could lead to emissions far exceeding the levels required to meet climate goals, thus exacerbating global warming."

Carbon pricing, through mechanisms like carbon taxes or auctioned emission allowances, helps to weaken the link between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and economic growth by making fossil fuel use more expensive and less attractive. This incentivizes shifts towards cleaner energy sources and technologies. Revenues generated from carbon pricing can be used to lower other taxes or provide financial support to low-income groups, thereby reducing the social costs of mitigation policies.\n\nSubsidies, on the other hand, can either promote or hinder fossil fuel reliance depending on their application. The removal of fossil fuel subsidies could lead to significant reductions in global emissions by making fossil fuels less economically viable. Conversely, subsidies for renewable energy (RE) technologies have been crucial in accelerating their deployment, driven by government policies aimed at energy access, economic development, and environmental concerns.

Integrated planning and decision-making, which consider both strategies, can effectively balance short-term adaptation needs with long-term mitigation goals, ensuring sustainable and equitable outcomes.\n\n**Explanation**: Mitigation reduces the rate and magnitude of climate change, allowing more time for adaptation, while adaptation addresses current and emerging risks. Both strategies complement each other by providing mutual benefits and supporting broader societal goals. Integrated approaches manage the complexities and trade-offs between short-term and long-term objectives, promoting climate-resilient pathways.",

However, their effectiveness can be limited by factors such as loose caps in cap and trade systems or insufficiently high carbon tax rates. When well-designed, they can provide a strong incentive for emission reductions.\n\n2. **Subsidies:** Subsidies can influence emissions across various sectors, particularly when targeted at renewable energy (RE) supply. The removal of fossil fuel subsidies, as suggested by some studies, could lead to significant reductions in global emissions by mid-century. However, the impact depends on the scope and nature of the subsidies removed.\n\n3. **Regulations and Information Measures:** These include energy efficiency standards and labelling programmes, which are often environmentally effective by directly mandating or encouraging specific actions. They can address sector-specific barriers and market failures but might not be as cost-effective as economy-wide carbon pricing mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the effectiveness of these instruments is context-dependent, and they can be synergistic when combined, such as using carbon pricing alongside RE subsidies."

These strategies reduce risks, enhance resilience, and secure assets, benefiting current and future populations. Proactive adaptation and mitigation policies offer economic and social incentives by reducing costs and promoting sustainable development. However, barriers such as limited resources, governance challenges, and social complexities must be addressed. Integrating diverse knowledge systems and fostering international cooperation are crucial for effective implementation.
