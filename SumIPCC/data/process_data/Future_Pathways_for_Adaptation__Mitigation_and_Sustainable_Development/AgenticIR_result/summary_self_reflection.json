  {
    "sub section 2.4": "Current trends indicate a gradual shift towards renewable energy sources, with renewables accounting for approximately 30% of global energy consumption. While fossil fuels still represent a significant portion of the energy mix, there is increasing focus on reducing dependency through various government policies and incentives."
  },
  {
    "sub section 2.5": "Co-benefits of mitigation actions include improved energy efficiency, transitions to cleaner energy sources, reduced energy and water consumption, sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, and ecosystem protection. These co-benefits illustrate the interconnectedness of climate mitigation with other areas such as public health and resource management."
  },
  {
    "sub section 2.6": "Different pathways for global mitigation efforts encompass bioenergy usage, carbon capture and storage (CCS), a combination of technologies, country-specific actions, a global carbon market, sustainable development strategies, and equity considerations. Effective decision-making involves a combination of these pathways to manage climate risks."
  },
  {
    "sub section 2.7": "Future mitigation scenarios being explored emphasize climate-resilient pathways that integrate sustainable development, varying by country based on their specific circumstances. Global cooperation and financial flows are essential for effective action in mitigating climate change."

    "sub section 2.8": "Emerging technologies for climate mitigation include bioenergy and CCS. These technologies can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, helping to achieve international climate targets such as those set by the Paris Agreement."
  },
  {
    "sub section 2.9": "Proven strategies for reducing emissions include implementing energy efficiency standards, carbon taxes, subsidies for renewable energy, cap-and-trade systems, and sector-specific policies. These strategies effectively contribute to lowering emissions and facilitating the transition to a low-carbon economy."
  },
  {
    "sub section 2.10": "Ignoring climate change mitigation carries severe risks, including irreversible impacts, increased vulnerability, threats to food security, higher economic costs, and disproportionate effects on marginalized communities. The urgency for immediate climate action is underscored by these potential consequences."
  },
  {
    "sub section 3.1": "Specific actions recommended for effective mitigation include pursuing climate-resilient pathways, engaging in timely mitigation efforts, informed decision-making, enhancing adaptive capacity, addressing equity, managing sector interactions, and implementing co-beneficial actions."
