    "sub section 1.1": "Since 2010, the overall risks associated with climate change have become increasingly severe and complex. Key risks include the amplification of existing risks, disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities, negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, and threats to food and human security. The global average temperature has risen by approximately 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, resulting in more frequent and severe weather events, while up to 1 million species are at risk of extinction due to climate change. Additionally, the interaction of climate hazards with the vulnerability and exposure of populations has contributed to a 20% increase in food insecurity globally since 2010. Rising temperatures and ocean acidification pose risks of severe, pervasive, and potentially irreversible impacts on ecosystems and human systems, necessitating urgent adaptation and mitigation strategies."

    "sub section 1.2": "Since 2010, observed trends in sea level rise have shown a significant acceleration, with the global mean sea level rising at an average rate of approximately 3.3 mm per year, surpassing the historical average of 2.0 mm/yr recorded from 1971 to 2010. Projections indicate that under various Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), particularly RCP8.5, the sea level rise could reach between 8 to 16 mm/yr by the end of the century. The primary causes include thermal expansion of seawater and melting ice sheets, especially in Greenland and Antarctica, which have profound implications for coastal flooding and erosion."
