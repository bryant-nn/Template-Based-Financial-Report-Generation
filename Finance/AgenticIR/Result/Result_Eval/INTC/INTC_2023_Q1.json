This represented a 13% decline from Q4 2022 and a year-over-year decrease, primarily due to lower demand, higher unit costs, and excess capacity charges. The results were better than expected, driven by strong performance in Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI (DCAI), Intel Foundry Services (IFS), and Mobileye, despite challenges in the Network and Edge markets.",
