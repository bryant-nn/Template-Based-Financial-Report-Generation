However, this marks a year-over-year (YoY) decrease of about 15%, driven by ongoing demand softness and elevated inventory levels in the network and edge markets. The revenue exceeded the midpoint of Q1 2023 guidance by over $900 million, with the positive performance attributed to strong results in Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI (DCAI), Intel Foundry Services (IFS), and Mobileye.",
