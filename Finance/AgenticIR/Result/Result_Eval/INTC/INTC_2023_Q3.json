However, there was significant revenue growth from Intel Foundry Services and Mobileye, offsetting some challenges. The revenue in Q3 2022 was also $14.2 billion, indicating no year-over-year change. The guidance from Q2 2023 projected $14.5 billion to $15.5 billion, suggesting a slight miss on the higher end of the forecast. Reasons for the changes include improvements in Intel Foundry Services, gains in market share, and the effective selling through of previously reserved inventory.",
