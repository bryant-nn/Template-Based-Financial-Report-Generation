The growth was attributed to strong demand from enterprise and government sectors, especially in data centers and PCs. Full-year revenue for 2021 reached $74.7 billion, showing a 2% increase compared to the previous year. The variations were influenced by competitive pressures and a slower recovery earlier in the year, offset by stronger demand in certain sectors.",
