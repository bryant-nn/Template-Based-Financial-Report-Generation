The revenue was consistent with guidance provided in Q3 2023, where the company had anticipated revenue between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion. Revenue changes were primarily influenced by a decline in Integrated Device Manufacturing (IFS) revenue, cyclical weaknesses in wafer equipment purchasing, and strategic exits from certain business lines resulting in an approximately $1 billion impact. Positive demand in the PC segment provided offsetting revenue but was not sufficient to negate decreases anticipated in data centers and inventory corrections in other areas such as Mobileye and PSG.",
