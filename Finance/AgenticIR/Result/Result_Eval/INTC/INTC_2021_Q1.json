This represented an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year (YoY) due to strong demand in the PC notebook and Mobileye businesses. The growth was driven by record notebook unit volumes and initial recovery in the enterprise and government sectors of the data center business. Sequentially, the revenue also increased because it exceeded guidance for Q4 2020 by $1.1 billion, which stood at $17.5 billion.",
