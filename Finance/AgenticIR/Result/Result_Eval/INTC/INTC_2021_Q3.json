These changes were influenced by industry-wide component supply constraints affecting enterprise customers, and a decline in lower-end system sales. However, growth was seen in higher-end products and segments like IOTG, which experienced a 54% year-over-year increase. Despite these challenges, Intel's Q3 revenue results exceeded guidance from Q2 2021, as the EPS was $1.71, surpassing the expected figures significantly.",
