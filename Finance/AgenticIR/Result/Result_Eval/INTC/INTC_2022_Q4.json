DCAI revenue saw a slight increase of 2% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). The revenue decline was primarily attributed to macroeconomic headwinds and rising inventory levels that affected customer demand, exceeding previous expectations regarding inventory management. Comparatively, these results were below the guidance provided in Q3 2022.",
