Year-on-year, revenue increased due to robust sales from the S23 series despite an overall market contraction. The revenue decrease was attributed to reduced demand in the memory business and the prevailing economic downturn. Compared to the guidance provided in Q4 2022, the results fell short due to unexpected adverse market conditions.",
