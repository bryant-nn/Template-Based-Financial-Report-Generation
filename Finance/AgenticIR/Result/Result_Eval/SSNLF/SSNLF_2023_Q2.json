This reflects a decrease of 5.9% year-over-year, primarily attributable to global economic conditions and inventory adjustments by customers, which weakened demand for major applications like mobile and PC products. Quarter-over-quarter, revenue increased due to peak seasonality in System on Chips (SoC) and Display Driver ICs (DDIs), as well as reduced inventory valuation losses in Memory, despite an overall decline due to decreased smartphone shipments.",
