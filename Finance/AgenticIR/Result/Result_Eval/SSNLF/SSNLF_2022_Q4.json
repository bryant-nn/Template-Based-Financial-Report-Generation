Year-on-year, the revenue showed strong performance, despite challenges in the Memory business and reduced smartphone demand. This decline was attributed to a significant ASP drop and inventory valuation losses in Memory, while the Foundry business achieved record revenue. Compared to the guidance from Q3 2022, the revenue results fell due to weak demand, particularly in the Memory sector, and substantial inventory valuation losses, though the Foundry performance partly offset this downturn.",
