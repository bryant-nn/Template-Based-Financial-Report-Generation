This growth was driven by strong demand across sectors including high-performance computing, IoT, and automotive. The revenue results slightly exceeded the guidance provided in the Q1 earnings call, which anticipated a sequential increase of approximately 11.2% for Q3. Reasons for the positive performance included favorable foreign exchange rates, cost improvements, and robust demand.",
