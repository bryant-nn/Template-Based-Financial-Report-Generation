The decline in revenue is attributed to global economic conditions affecting end market demand and customers adjusting their inventory levels. Additionally, lower capacity utilization and increased costs of electricity contributed to this decline. Although there was no specific revenue guidance from Q1 2023, the updated outlook for the second half of 2023 indicates a potential revenue growth of 10% to 12% compared to the first half.",
