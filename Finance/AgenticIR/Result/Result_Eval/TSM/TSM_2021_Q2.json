This represents a sequential increase of 2.7% in NT dollar terms and 2.9% in USD from the previous quarter. A year-over-year change could not be detailed due to a lack of specific figures for Q2 2020. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by strong demand in the high-performance computing (HPC) and automotive sectors, although there was a decrease in revenue from smartphone and IoT sectors. TSMCâ€™s revenue guidance from Q1 2021 suggested growth above 20% in USD terms for the full year, which the Q2 results indicate was achieved.",
