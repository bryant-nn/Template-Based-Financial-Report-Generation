In comparison, TSM's revenue for Q3 2023 was approximately US$69 billion. The drop in revenue is largely attributed to increased demand for AI applications, particularly following the rise of ChatGPT, resulting in a demand surge leading to expanded capacity in both front-end and back-end processes. The company's performance against guidance for Q3 is not explicitly detailed but indicates high demand in the market.",
