The growth was mainly driven by strong demand in high-performance computing (HPC), despite a milder smartphone seasonality. The quarter saw some challenges which led to a decrease in gross margin by 1.6 percentage points to 52.4%, and operating margin decreased by 2 percentage points to 41.5%. The full-year guidance indicated a revenue growth of around 20% based on ongoing strong demand across various applications including potential price adjustments.",
