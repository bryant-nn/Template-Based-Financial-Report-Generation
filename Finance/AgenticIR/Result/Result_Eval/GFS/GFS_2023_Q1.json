This was primarily due to reduced wafer shipments, although this decline was partially offset by improved average selling price (ASP) and product mix. Adjusted gross margin was reported at 28.5%, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) stood at $0.52, which was at the high end of their guidance range. For Q2 2023, GFS anticipates revenue to be between $1.81 billion and $1.85 billion, with a forecasted decline in revenue in the mid to high-single digits for the full year.",
