The primary drivers of this growth were strong demand for UMC's differentiated processes, higher average selling prices, and beneficial foreign exchange rates. However, the company experienced a net operating loss of NT$2.58 billion due to investment portfolio impacts from the capital market weaknesses. The diluted EPS for the quarter was NT$1.74, an increase from NT$1.61 in Q1 2022 and NT$0.98 in Q2 2021.",
