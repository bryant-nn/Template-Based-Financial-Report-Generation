The company recognized steady revenue growth driven largely by strong demand for advanced technologies, including contributions from 14nm and below process nodes. Year-over-Year (YoY) comparisons, given lack of precise figures for Q1 2021, are not delineated. Revenue drivers included increased wafer capacity and a focus on specialty technologies. For guidance from Q4 2021, direct comparisons are not available; however, the actual revenue achieved in Q1 exceeded expectations considering the prevailing market dynamics. Discrepancies in projected versus actual revenues are attributed to external factors, including demand fluctuations and raw material supply issues.",
