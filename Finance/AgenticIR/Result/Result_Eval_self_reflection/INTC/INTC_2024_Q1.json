The growth was primarily driven by a 17% increase in Intel Products, while inventory challenges in Mobileye and Altera, along with the sunsetting of noncore businesses, negatively impacted results. Gross margin was 45.1%, exceeding guidance, and EPS was $0.18, beating guidance by $0.05. Net income was -$381 million, indicating ongoing challenges. Management expects improvements in the second half of 2024, with a focus on recovering from inventory digestion and enhancing operational efficiencies.",
