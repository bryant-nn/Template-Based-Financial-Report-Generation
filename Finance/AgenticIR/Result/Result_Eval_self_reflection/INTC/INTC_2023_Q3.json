The revenue exceeded guidance by $750 million. The increase in revenue QoQ was attributed to improved demand and operational efficiencies, while the YoY decline was influenced by elevated inventory levels and weak demand conditions. Looking ahead, Intel expects Q4 revenue to range between $14.6 billion and $15.6 billion, indicating a commitment to sequential growth throughout 2023.",

However, Intel did experience a meaningful improvement in wafer ASP driven by enhanced loadings and a reduction in underload charges. Although the company is largely out of the woods concerning underload issues, some inventory costs still need attention. Increased demand, especially from AI customers, is anticipated to drive further improvements in wafer ASP going forward.",
