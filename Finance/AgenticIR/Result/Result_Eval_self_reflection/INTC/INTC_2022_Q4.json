The decline was primarily attributed to deteriorating market conditions within the PC segment and elevated customer inventory levels. Revenue from the Client Computing Group (CCG) was $6.6 billion, which constituted a significant drop from prior periods. The Data Center and AI (DCAI) segment generated $4.3 billion, down 33% year-over-year but showing a slight sequential increase. Compared to guidance from Q3 2022, Intel had to revise its revenue expectations downwards by $13 billion due to worsening macroeconomic conditions, indicating a considerable shift in market dynamics.",
