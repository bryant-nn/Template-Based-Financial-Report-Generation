Year-over-year, revenue declined by 8% from $14.5 billion in Q3 2023. This growth was driven primarily by increased demand in the data center segment, particularly for traditional servers, despite challenges such as significant reductions in shipments to China. The revenue results were in the upper half of Intel's guidance provided in August 2024. Analysts expect continued improvements, projecting revenue to reach around $14 billion in Q4 2024 with the introduction of new product lines.",
