Year-over-year comparisons are not available. Management highlighted that they faced substantial inventory adjustments described as a \"once in 10-year\" occurrence as customers aligned their inventories with shifting demand. Despite these hurdles, they announced over 10 new revenue-generating product lines expected to launch in the latter half of 2022 and into 2023. Management remains optimistic about recovery, noting a strong replacement cycle for over 600 million PCs older than four years.",
