The decline was primarily due to weak demand in the consumer, education, and small-medium business markets, inventory reductions, and competitive pressures. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation and geopolitical tensions, also contributed to the challenging environment. Compared to Q2 2022 guidance, the results were lower than expected, reflecting ongoing market headwinds and a cautious outlook for Q4.",
