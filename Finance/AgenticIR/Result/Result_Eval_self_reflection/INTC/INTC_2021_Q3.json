This represents a year-over-year decline caused primarily by lower demand in the PC segment and industry-wide supply constraints impacting overall performance. The Company achieved significant growth in the data center segment, but challenges in the component supply chain and regulatory issues in China adversely affected other areas. QoQ comparisons are not explicitly available, but guidance previously indicated anticipated revenue around $18.3 billion for Q4 2021, highlighting recovery efforts.",
