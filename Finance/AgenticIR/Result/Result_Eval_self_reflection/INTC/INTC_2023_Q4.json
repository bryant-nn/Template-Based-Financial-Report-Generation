This growth was influenced by strong performance in the gaming and commercial segments, as well as a favorable product mix. When comparing to the previous quarter, Q3 2023, where revenue was approximately $15.1 billion, this indicates a quarter-over-quarter increase of about 2%. In contrast, Q4 2023 exceeded the companyâ€™s guidance by approximately $300 million, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated demand in certain markets and improved inventory levels. The operating income for this quarter was reported at $2.6 billion, with net income reaching $2.67 billion and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.63. The significant year-over-year increase can be attributed to enhanced market share in key product areas and successful strategies that addressed previous supply chain constraints. Management provided a cautious outlook for Q1 2024, guiding revenue expectations between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion, which reflects anticipated seasonal trends and ongoing inventory corrections.",
