The year-over-year revenue decrease was attributed to challenging demand conditions, particularly in the Consumer and Education segments, alongside higher unit costs. Despite the decline, the Q1 2023 revenue exceeded the Q4 2022 guidance of around $11 billion by approximately $700 million. Operating profit remained flat at $520 million, with a gross margin of 38.4%, which was slightly below the forecasted guidance due to higher inventory reserves. The diluted earnings per share (EPS) were negative $0.04, better than previously expected. Looking forward, management anticipates sequential revenue growth as market conditions improve.",
