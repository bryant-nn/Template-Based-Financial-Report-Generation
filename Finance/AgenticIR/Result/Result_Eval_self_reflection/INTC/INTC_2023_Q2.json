        "sub section 1.1": "In Q2 2023, Intel's total revenue was $12.949 billion, reflecting a decrease from $15.329 billion in Q2 2022. This decline of 15.6% year-over-year can be attributed to ongoing market challenges and shifts in demand. However, there was a 55.4% quarter-over-quarter increase, up from $8.3 billion in Q1 2023. The increase QoQ was driven by a strong performance in Client Computing Group (CCG), Data Center and AI (DCAI), Intel Foundry Services (IFS), and Mobileye. Looking ahead, Intel anticipates sequential revenue growth, driven largely by AI-related products and services. The discrepancies in revenue against guidance were primarily due to a slower-than-expected recovery in key markets, despite a successful quarter overall.",
