This growth was primarily driven by higher memory prices and strong sales of premium display products, even as smartphone shipments declined due to fierce competition. Year-over-year, this figure also increased from KRW 64.5 trillion in Q4 2022. The company expects ongoing revenue growth in Q1 2024, with guidance indicating a potential increase of 3-4%.",
