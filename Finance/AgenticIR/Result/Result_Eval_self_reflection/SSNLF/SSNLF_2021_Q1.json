This growth was primarily driven by strong smartphone sales and heightened demand for PC and mobile LED memory, despite challenges in the display business. The operating profit rose to KRW 9.4 trillion, supported by improved profitability in the consumer electronics division. The display business faced weak seasonality, impacting overall performance, but increased utilization of mobile OLEDs contributed positively. Looking ahead, the company remains focused on navigating market challenges while capitalizing on strong product demand.",
