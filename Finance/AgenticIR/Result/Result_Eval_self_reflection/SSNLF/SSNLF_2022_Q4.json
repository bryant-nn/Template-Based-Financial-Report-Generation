This drop was influenced by weak demand amid an economic slowdown and significant inventory adjustments in the Memory business. Despite this, the company achieved a record annual revenue for 2022, driven by strong performance in earlier quarters. Analysts anticipate a recovery in 2023, with expectations for revenue growth as market conditions stabilize.",
