The growth was driven by robust sales of foldable smartphones, increased memory shipments, and OLED sales, despite facing supply chain disruptions and soft demand for client SSDs. The company aimed to normalize inventory levels which were extremely low at the end of the previous quarter, anticipating a recovery in demand for the upcoming quarters. This positive outlook indicates that annual revenue is expected to exceed previous records.",
