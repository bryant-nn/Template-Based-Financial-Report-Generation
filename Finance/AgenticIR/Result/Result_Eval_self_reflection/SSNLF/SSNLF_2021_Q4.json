The revenue experienced a slight decline in operating profit to KRW 13.9 trillion due to rising costs associated with logistics and a special bonus payment, but net profit reached around KRW 10 billion. Compared to guidance from Q3 2021, revenue exceeded expectations due to strong sales in premium products, despite challenges such as declining memory prices and increased selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), which rose to KRW 17.8 trillion. The overall market demand and seasonal factors contributed to this performance.",
