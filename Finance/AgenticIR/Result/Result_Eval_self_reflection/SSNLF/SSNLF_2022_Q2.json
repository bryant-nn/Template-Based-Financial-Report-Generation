        "sub section 1.1": "In Q2 2022, SSNLF experienced fluctuating revenue results, primarily due to various market conditions. Revenue decreased quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) as a result of geopolitical issues and inflationary pressures impacting overall demand, particularly in the smartphone market. However, compared to Q2 2021, the revenue was up, attributed to strong sales of flagship smartphone models, particularly the Galaxy S22 series. Challenges included increased material costs and a decline in smartphone demand, but strong performance in the mobile display business helped offset some losses. The company's revenue was affected by anticipated macroeconomic impacts, leading to a cautious outlook for the second half of 2022.",
