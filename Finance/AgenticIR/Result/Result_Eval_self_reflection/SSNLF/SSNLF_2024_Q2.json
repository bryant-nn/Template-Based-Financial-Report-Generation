        "sub section 1.1": "In Q2 2024, SSNLF reported total revenue of KRW 74.1 trillion, a 3% increase from KRW 72 trillion in Q1 2024. Year-over-year, revenue showed a substantial rise compared to KRW 18.5 trillion in Q2 2023, reflecting a fourfold growth. This increase was mainly driven by a 23% growth in the Device Solutions (DS) Division, thanks to a recovery in the Memory business, alongside a remarkable 42% increase in Displays revenue due to strong OLED sales. However, the Mobile Experience (MX) division experienced a 19% decline due to weak smartphone demand. The anticipated growth in revenues is attributed to solid demand for high-value segments, despite challenges in the MX division. Comparatively, the guidance from Q1 2024 anticipated a steadier growth which was achieved, underlining the strength in the DS sector.",
