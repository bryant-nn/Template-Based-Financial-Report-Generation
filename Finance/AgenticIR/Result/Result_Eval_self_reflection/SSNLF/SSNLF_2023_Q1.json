The revenue drop was primarily driven by decreased demand in the Memory business and other components, influenced by weakening consumer sentiment amid global economic uncertainties. However, the DX division saw increased revenue due to strong sales of new flagship smartphone models. Looking ahead, the company aims for annual revenue growth in 2023 by improving product mix and operational efficiencies.",
