This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in the semiconductor sector and premium home appliances. The QoQ change indicated a decrease from the previous quarter, attributed to seasonality, component supply constraints, and production challenges. Management noted that total revenue for Q2 was lower than Q1 but showed significant year-on-year growth. The revenue results did not meet the guidance from Q1 2021, partly due to these mitigating factors.",
