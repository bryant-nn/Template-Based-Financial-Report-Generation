The revenue growth was primarily driven by strong demand for 5-nanometer technologies, particularly in smartphone and high-performance computing applications. However, the management highlighted ongoing inventory adjustments, which are expected to lead to a flat business outlook for Q4 2022, as segments related to consumer markets experienced softness while data center and automotive sectors remained steady. The revenue result did not specify the year-over-year change, and specific guidance comparison from Q2 2022 was not made clearly in the discussions.",
