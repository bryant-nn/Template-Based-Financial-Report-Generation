This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in high-performance computing (HPC) and automotive sectors. In Q1 2021, the revenue was approximately TWD 362.4 billion (USD 12.0 billion), indicating a QoQ increase of 2.7% in NT dollar terms and 2.9% in U.S. dollar terms. Possible reasons for revenue changes include increased demand in HPC and automotive sectors, although smartphone revenue experienced a decline of 3%. The revenue results in Q2 were slightly above guidance due to strong market conditions, reflecting robust customer needs.",
