This drop in revenue can be attributed to inventory corrections among customers and reduced demand in sectors such as smartphones and IoT. Comparatively, TSMC's Q2 2023 revenue was lower than the previous quarter's $16.33 billion, and the company did not provide specific revenue guidance in Q1 but is expecting a revenue increase of 10% to 12% in the second half of 2023 driven by new product launches and recovering market demand.",
