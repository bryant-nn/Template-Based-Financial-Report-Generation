The net income for the quarter was about $6.54 billion, translating to an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.26. The growth was driven by strong demand for advanced technologies, particularly the ramp-up of 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer nodes. Management expressed optimism for continued healthy growth into 2024, supported by stable demand in the PC and smartphone markets, despite macroeconomic uncertainties. Comparatively, revenue exceeded previous guidance given in Q2, mainly due to enhanced demand across key sectors.",
