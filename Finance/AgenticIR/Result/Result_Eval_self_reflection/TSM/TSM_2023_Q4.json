However, there was an 8.7% decrease year-over-year, influenced by ongoing demand for advanced semiconductor technologies, particularly in the automotive and AI sectors, despite challenges in the global semiconductor market. The previous guidance for Q4 2023 projected revenue of approximately $20.38 billion, slightly higher than the actual results, with a noted decrease in gross margin to 53% from 54.4% due to margin dilution from the ramp-up of 3-nanometer technology.",
