The revenue aligns with the guidance provided for Q4 2023. A slight decline in revenue is attributed to a decrease in utilization rate to 65%, despite a 4.5% increase in wafer shipments, indicating mixed demand dynamics in the semiconductor market. UMC anticipates improved wafer shipments in Q2 2024 as inventory levels stabilize.",
