The growth in revenue was primarily driven by strong demand across various segments, especially in the automotive and consumer electronics markets. Reasons for the revenue changes include a 1.7% increase in wafer shipments to 2.55 million 8-inch equivalents and a significant 75% year-over-year increase from 28-nanometer technologies. The company anticipates continued growth in the first quarter of 2022 due to ongoing high demand. Guidance from Q3 2021 suggested positive trends, although precise figures were not disclosed.",
