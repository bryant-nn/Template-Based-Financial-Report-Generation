The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by ongoing macroeconomic challenges, resulting in a 2.5% drop in wafer shipments and a reduced fab utilization rate of 66%. These results fell short of Q3 2023 guidance, which had anticipated stronger revenue performance due to improved market conditions.",
