The revenue increase was driven by robust wafer demand and full capacity utilization. The results were in line with the guidance from Q4 2020, supported by higher average selling prices (ASP) and increased shipments, particularly in 28-nanometer technology, which is crucial for digital TVs and set-top boxes.",
