        "sub section 1.1": "In Q3 2022, UMC reported consolidated revenue of TWD 75.39 billion, reflecting a 4.6% increase from the previous quarter, primarily driven by product mix optimization and strong demand in the wireless communication sector, despite softening demand in consumer markets. The year-over-year change in revenue is not provided, but the growth from Q2 2022 indicates a favorable performance. The increase in revenue was supported by the robust performance of the 22/28 nanometer business segment, which constituted 25% of total revenue. However, potential challenges from inflation and global events may affect future revenue performance. The comparison to guidance from Q2 2022 is not available, making it difficult to assess how it aligns with prior expectations, but discrepancies noted were largely attributed to inventory corrections in the market.",
