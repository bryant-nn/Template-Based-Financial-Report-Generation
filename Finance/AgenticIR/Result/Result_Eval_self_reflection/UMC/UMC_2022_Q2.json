This growth was primarily driven by strong demand across various end-markets, including the 22/28 nanometer portfolio, which saw a 29% revenue increase sequentially. Management noted that the results were in line with previous guidance from Q1 2022, which anticipated a gross margin in the mid-40% range. Factors influencing the revenue changes included favorable foreign exchange rates and adjusted product mixes due to inventory corrections in the semiconductor industry.",
