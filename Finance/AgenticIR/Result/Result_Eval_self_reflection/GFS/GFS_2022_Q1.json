This notable increase was driven by a 48% rise in wafer shipments and higher average selling prices (ASP). The favorable demand across various sectors significantly contributed to this performance, alongside effective operational execution, despite some normalization in low-end handsets and PCs. In comparison to guidance from Q4 2021, the revenue results exceeded expectations. The strong revenue growth highlights GFS's robust market position and operational capabilities.",
