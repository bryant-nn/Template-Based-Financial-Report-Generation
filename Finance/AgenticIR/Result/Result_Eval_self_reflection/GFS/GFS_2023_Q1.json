This decrease was primarily due to reduced wafer shipments influenced by broader industry challenges. The revenue drop was partially mitigated by improvements in average selling price (ASP) and product mix. The adjusted gross margin was reported at 28.5%, which was at the high end of guidance provided in Q4 2022. Management anticipates further challenges in the near future with expectations for a mid to high-single-digit percentage decline in revenue for 2023, partially offset by anticipated gradual recovery during the second half of the year.",
