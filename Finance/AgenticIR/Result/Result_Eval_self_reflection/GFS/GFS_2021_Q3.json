This growth was driven by higher wafer shipments and a favorable product mix, particularly in the smart mobile end market, which saw a 45% year-over-year increase. Looking ahead, GFS anticipates continued growth due to the ongoing demand for 5G technology. The revenue increased by 5% from Q2 to Q3 in 2021, moving from approximately $1.62 billion to about $1.7 billion. The demand for semiconductors, especially in the automotive and IoT sectors, contributed significantly to this increase. However, specific revenue results vs. guidance from Q2 2021 were not available.",
