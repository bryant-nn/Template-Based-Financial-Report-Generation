However, it represents a 12% decrease from Q2 2023, primarily influenced by reduced shipments and lower utilization levels. The increase in revenue was chiefly driven by heightened demand in the automotive sector, alongside a normalization of customer inventory levels. The company exceeded its guidance provided for Q1 2024, which indicated a revenue expectation in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.56 billion.",
