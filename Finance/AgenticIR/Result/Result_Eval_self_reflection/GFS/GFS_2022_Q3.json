Revenue from the communications infrastructure and data center market accounted for about 18% of total revenue, growing approximately 29% from the previous year driven by higher shipments and improved average selling prices (ASPs). The automotive market contributed around 5% and is expected to grow significantly due to new product introductions. Continued growth in the automotive sector indicates a strong outlook for the company despite facing challenges in the compute market, which represented only about 2% of revenue. The revenue guidance for Q4 is projected to be between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion, indicating a cautious perspective due to anticipated reductions in capacity utilization and product demand.",
