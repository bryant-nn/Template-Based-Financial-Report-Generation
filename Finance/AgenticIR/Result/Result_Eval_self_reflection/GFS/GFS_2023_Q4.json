The growth is attributed to improved demand and effective inventory management amidst ongoing semiconductor industry dynamics. While specific Q3 guidance was not detailed, management indicated expectations for continued revenue growth in 2024, driven by strong consumer demand and strategic initiatives.",

The average selling price (ASP) per wafer decreased by approximately 7% year-over-year, primarily due to changes in the product mix. This decline in ASP reflects ongoing inventory dynamics and competitive pressures in the semiconductor market. Despite this, GFS expects to see sequential revenue growth in 2024, indicating a cautious but optimistic outlook for wafer sales.",
