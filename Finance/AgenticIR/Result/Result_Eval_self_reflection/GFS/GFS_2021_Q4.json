The revenue increased 9% quarter-on-quarter, driven by higher wafer output, increased average selling prices (ASPs), and growth in non-wafer revenue. Year-over-year, GFS achieved a 36% increase in total revenue for the full year, despite a planned decline in personal compute revenue. This growth reflects strong demand across most end markets and improved product mix, although challenges in the personal compute sector were anticipated. Looking ahead, GFS aims to maintain this momentum through strategic investments and operational efficiencies.",
