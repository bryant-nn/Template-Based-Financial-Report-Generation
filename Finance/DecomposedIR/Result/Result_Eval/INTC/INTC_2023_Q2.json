NEX revenue was $1.4 billion, below our expectations in the quarter and down significantly in comparison to a record Q2 ‘22. Network and edge markets are slowly working through elevated inventory levels. Elongated by sluggish China recovery, and telcos have delayed infrastructure investments due to macro uncertainty. We see demand remaining weak through at least the third quarter. Q2 NEX operating loss of $187 million improved sequentially on lower inventory reserves and reduced operating expenses.

I mean, I think there will be multiple opportunities over the course of multiple years to improve the gross margin. So, Pat has talked about a pretty significant improvement in gross margins over time. And I think what we’re seeing today is the beginnings of seeing that improvement show up in the P&L.\\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\\nJoe Moore: Dave, I think you said in your prepared remarks that data center pricing was up 17% year-on-year and that Sapphire Rapids was a factor there. Can you just talk to that? And kind of obviously, Sapphire Rapids is going to get bigger. Can you talk about what you expect to see with platform cost in DCAI?\\nDavid Zinsner: Platform costs, okay. Well, first of all, ASP is obviously improving as we increase core count and as we get more competitive on the product offerings, that enables us to have more",

Well, first of all, ASP is obviously improving as we increase core count and as we get more competitive on the product offerings, that enables us to have more confidence in the market in terms of our pricing. So that’s certainly helpful. Obviously, with the increase in core count, that affects the cost as well. So, cost obviously goes up. But the longer -- the larger drivers of our cost structure will be around what we do in terms of the internal foundry model as we get up in terms of scale and get away from these underloading charges, and as we get past the start-up costs on 5 nodes in 4 years, which data center is certainly getting hit with. And so those things, I think, longer term will be the biggest drivers of gross margin improvement. And as we get -- launch Sierra Forest in the first half of next year and Granite later thereafter and start to produce products on the data center side that are really competitive, that enables us to even be stronger",
                        "the revenue increase side, which I know is important, can you just walk us through some of the pluses and minuses sequentially into the third quarter and even into the back half, some of the pre-PRQ reversals under utilization? Any of those kind of idiosyncratic blocks that we should be aware of as we think about the gross margin in the second half of the year?\\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Good question, Ross. So in the second quarter, just to repeat what I said in the prepared remarks, that was largely a function of revenue. We had obviously beat revenue significantly and we got a good fall-through, given the fixed cost nature of our business. And so that really was what helped us really outperform significantly on the gross margin side in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we do, obviously, at the midpoint, see revenue growth sequentially. And so that will be helpful in terms of gross margin improvement. We expect, again, pretty good fall-through as we get that incremental revenue."
