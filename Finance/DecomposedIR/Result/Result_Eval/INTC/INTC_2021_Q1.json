A lot of that was driven exactly as you asked in the question by cloud digestion. We had an extraordinary last year. But now customers are almost through the digestion of that and we are starting to see signs that they want to start the next build phase in their cloud.

The digitization of everything was remarkably accelerated by COVID and has spurred innovation and new models of working and learning, interacting and care. Technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence and semiconductors are the foundation. This is creating a cycle of explosive growth in semiconductors that will result in sustained growth for a decade or more. The PC ecosystem in particular is experiencing resurgence. This remote work and learning dynamic of COVID led to more PC shipments in 2020 than at any point since 2012 and that’s continuing. 2021 is shaping up to be the largest PC market ever.
