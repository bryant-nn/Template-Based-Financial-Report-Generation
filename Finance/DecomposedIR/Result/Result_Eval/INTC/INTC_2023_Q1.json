This was primarily driven by increased average selling prices (ASPs) and improved external supply, which allowed the company to address its customer backlog.\n\n2. **Segment Performance**:\n   - **CCG (Client Computing Group)**: Achieved $5.8 billion in revenue, surpassing expectations despite a challenging demand environment, particularly in the Consumer and Education segments. This was attributed to Intel's leadership in product performance.\n   - **NEX (Network and Edge)**: Revenue was $1.5 billion, falling short of expectations due to demand softness and elevated inventory levels.\n   - **Mobileye**: Delivered record first-quarter revenue of $458 million, up 16% year-over-year, driven by a 6% increase in content per vehicle.\n   - **IFS (Intel Foundry Services)**: Revenue was $118 million, with notable sequential growth in Packaging revenue.\n   - **DCAI (Data Center and AI)**: Revenue was $3.7 billion, exceeding expectations in the Xeon, PSG, and AXG lines of business.\n\n3. **Guidance Alignment**: The revenue results were mixed in terms of alignment with previous guidance. Some segments, like CCG and DCAI, performed better than expected, while others, like NEX, underperformed. Overall, the company anticipated challenges with inventory levels and demand, which were reflected in the revenue outcomes.

And then lastly, you have, as Pat was talking about, this whole notion of the internal foundry model, which just drives a lot of attention on cost and where we think we're going to get a lot of that $8 billion to $10 billion of savings exiting 2025. So I think, the way I look at it at least is that we put forth a model for gross margins. We changed the depreciation, which incrementally raises that target. And there's nothing that's going on at the company that would suggest that we're off pace from that. We think we are going to achieve that. The timing is obviously a function somewhat of the market.

I think what Pat said is, we thought things would be modestly better in the second half of the year.

That's what gives us the confidence of comfortably in the 40s, and we're not providing any specific revenue guidance on the second half?\\nPat Gelsinger: Well, I'd say there's three things to just think about for the second half.
