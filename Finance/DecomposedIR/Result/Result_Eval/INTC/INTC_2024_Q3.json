Q3 revenue was down 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by a more than 50% reduction in shipments to China, where comparisons will become easier as the exposure is now significantly smaller. Cash generation was quite strong, as operating cash flow was well above operating income. Altera delivered revenue of $412 million up 14% sequentially, consistent with guidance to support improved lead times by our distribution partners.

We anticipate inventory normalization will continue through the first half of next year. Now turning to our Q4 guidance. We successfully worked down client customer inventory levels in Q3, in line with our expectations and despite continued client customer inventory reductions in Q4, CCG should grow towards the higher end of seasonal, often abnormal Q3.

However, Panther Lake, the subsequent product, is anticipated to improve margins due to a better product-level margin and increased internal wafer mix, which also benefits the foundry business.\n\nOn the Foundry side, while specific gross margins are not reported, there is an expectation of improvement due to cost efficiencies and spending reductions, contributing to better margin performance in the coming year.
