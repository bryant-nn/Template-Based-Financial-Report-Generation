            "summary": "In 2022 Q2, revenue changes were primarily influenced by year-over-year (YoY) variations in specific segments: Data Center Networking Products saw an 11% increase, AXG rose by 5%, Mobileye achieved a 41% increase, while IFS experienced a 54% decline. The company revised its full-year revenue guidance downward from $76 billion to a range of $65 billion to $68 billion, due to lower expectations in the Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center and AI (DCAI) businesses. This revision aligns with a more conservative market outlook, impacted by inventory corrections, supply chain issues, and a revised PC Total Addressable Market (TAM) projection.

They expect this to increase to the low end of their target range of 51% to 53% in Q4 as revenue grows and cost efficiencies are realized.\n\n2. **Operating Profit Margins**:\n   - **CCG (Client Computing Group)**: The operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 73% year-over-year due to lower revenue and increased costs related to advanced technology nodes.\n   - **DCAI (Data Center and AI Group)**: Operating profit was $214 million, down 90% year-over-year. This decline was attributed to lower revenue, higher startup costs for advanced nodes, and increased investments.\n   - **NEX (Network and Edge Group)**: Achieved record quarterly revenue of $2.3 billion with an operating profit of $241 million, down 60% year-over-year due to a mix shift towards networking products.\n\nThese figures indicate that while Intel is experiencing challenges in maintaining operating profit margins across its segments, it is aiming to improve gross margins through increased revenue and efficiency in the latter part of the year."
