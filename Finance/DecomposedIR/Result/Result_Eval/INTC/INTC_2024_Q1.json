This shift is driven by aggressive volume ramps for server products and the transition from pre-EUV to post-EUV wafers, projected to significantly boost ASP growth and enhance profitability.\n\nExplanation: The increase in wafer sales volume and anticipated rise in ASP are attributed to Intel's strategic focus on transitioning to advanced nodes and ramping up production for high ASP server products.

And it really shows up more meaningfully in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And so that puts a little added pressure on gross margins. As you point out, the upside in the revenue, we will have good fall-through in Q3 and Q4, that will help lift the gross margins from where they are today. And then on top of that, we'll see some areas which have high gross margins, helping us like, for example, Mobileye, we get good gross margin for Mobileye and the strength that we'll see through the year there and products like that will also help drive better gross margins in the back half of the year. \\n As we look into '25, I think we'll have better gross margins than '25 than we had in '24.

You did say it's going to be better next year, but it is really whipping around a lot. And it looks like you sort of have to exit this year at 48 or maybe a little higher, which is already well above the 45.5 that you'll be at this year because you're guiding it up to 100 basis points. So I know you don't want to guide next year, but if you can even qualitatively help us, can you sustain those margins at that level? And I asked because last year, you sort of exited at 49% and then things crashed here during the first half of the year. So can you help us just think about what some of the puts and takes will be next year off of that high base if you're going to exit this year at? \\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. Good question. So there will be additional start-up costs next year. We do think it on a percent of revenue basis, it",

So ordinarily, we take a whole bunch of reserves on Sierra Forest and then we would release them as we started shipping beyond the PRQ date. We won't be doing that going forward. So that should help adjust the volatility of the gross margin. So it will be more a function of revenue growth spending profile in the fabs, start-up costs that we have and the mix. \\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up question? \\nTimothy Arcuri: I do. I do, yes. So I want to ask about server CPU share. March -- I think the assumption for March was that service share was going to be pretty flat. So the question is, was that the case?
