Key revenue figures included $1 billion for IOTG (up 54% YoY), $478 million for PSG (up 16% YoY), $326 million for Mobileye (up 39% YoY), and $9.7 billion for CCG (down 2% YoY). Despite these gains, revenue was slightly below guidance due to supply constraints and softness in the PRC cloud sector. QoQ, the company forecasts $18.3 billion for Q4, an increase of $200 million from Q3.
