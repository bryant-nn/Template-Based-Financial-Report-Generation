This growth was primarily driven by the ramp-up of 3-nanometer technology, which contributed 15% of wafer revenue, aligning with the company's guidance that anticipated strong HPC demand. Management expects HPC to continue driving growth, despite an anticipated revenue decline in the next quarter due to smartphone seasonality.

This indicates strong and consistent demand within the HPC segment.\n\n2. **Smartphone**: The smartphone segment decreased by 8% for the full year but increased significantly by 27% in Q4, also representing 43% of the revenue in the fourth quarter and 38% for the full year. This suggests a recovery or seasonal demand increase in the latter part of the year.\n\n3. **Internet of Things (IoT)**: IoT experienced a decline of 17% for the full year and a steep decrease of 29% in Q4, contributing only 5% to the fourth quarter revenue and 8% for the entire year. This indicates a declining trend in demand for IoT wafers.\n\n4. **Automotive**: The automotive segment showed growth, increasing by 15% for the full year and 13% in Q4, accounting for 5% of the revenue in both the fourth quarter and the full year. This reflects a growing demand trend in the automotive sector.\n\n5. **Digital Consumer Electronics (DCE)**: DCE decreased by 16% over the year and 35% in Q4, contributing 2% to the fourth quarter revenue. This indicates a significant reduction in demand within this segment.\n\nOverall, the demand trends show strong growth in HPC and automotive, a recovery in smartphones towards the end of the year, and declining demand in IoT and DCE segments."

Just a quick follow-up and I just want to say thanks a lot for all support. Just to follow-up, in terms of the revenue growth for this year, December quarter you exited HPC and smartphone, roughly 43% of revenue. What's going to drive the growth this year? Is HPC or smartphone, which is going to be better this year to get to the low to mid-20%?\\nJeff Su: Okay. Krish, Sorry. Again, we could not hear you that clearly, but I think I got the gist just for your question. Maybe the way Krish's question is what the components that's driving the revenue growth this year, maybe we can share with him by the four growth platforms?\\nWendell Huang: Chris, the HPC will have the highest growth, actually much higher than the corporate. The other three platforms will all grow, although slower than the corporate.\\nKrish",

However, macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical uncertainties persist, potentially further weighing on consumer sentiment and the end market demand.  Having said that, our business has buttoned out on a year-over-year basis and we expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technologies, strong demand for the 5-nanometer technologies and robust AI-related demand. Coming off the steep inventory correction and low base of 2023. For the full year of 2024, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory to increase by more than 10% year-over-year.  While foundry industry growth is forecast to be approximately 20%. For TSMC, supported by our technology leadership, a broader customer base, we are confident to outperform the foundry industry growth. We expect our business to grow quarter-over-quarters throughout 2024 and our full-year revenue expect to increase by",

Today's situation that we cannot offer enough capacity to support our customer. And that condition will continue probably all the way to next year. Although, we are working very hard to increase the capacity, for example, this year, we are doubling our output and still not enough, and so we continue to increase for the next year. The progress, so far so good because we invested on the advanced packaging technology for more than 10 years already. So, we expect the growth rate for CoWoS for 3D IC or for SoIC per se, it will be more than 50% CAGR in the next few years, at least. And so, we are confident that the demand is there. It's TSMC's capability to offer enough capacity to support our customer. \\nLaura Chen: For CoWoS, you will be doubling and what's the idea about the next year? Do you have any preliminary thought? \\nC. C. Wei: I will talk to you next year. \\nJeff Su: We"

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations for TSMC include:\n\n1. **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Growth**: HPC is anticipated to have the highest growth among TSMC's platforms, significantly exceeding corporate growth. This is expected to be a major driver of revenue growth.\n\n2. **3-Nanometer and 5-Nanometer Technologies**: Strong demand for TSMC's industry-leading 3-nanometer technologies and robust demand for 5-nanometer technologies are expected to support future sales growth.\n\n3. **AI-Related Demand**: There is robust demand for AI-related technologies, which is expected to contribute positively to TSMC's revenue.\n\n4. **Capacity Expansion**: TSMC is working to increase its capacity, including doubling output, to meet strong customer demand, which will support sales growth.\n\n5. **Foundry Industry Growth**: The foundry industry is forecasted to grow by approximately 20%, and TSMC expects to outperform this growth rate due to its technology leadership and broader customer base.\n\nKey risks include:\n\n1. **Macroeconomic Weakness and Geopolitical Uncertainties**: These factors could negatively impact consumer sentiment and end-market demand.\n\n2. **Capacity Constraints**: Despite efforts to increase capacity, there is a risk that TSMC may not be able to meet all customer demand.\n\nOverall, while the growth prospects are strong, potential risks from macroeconomic and geopolitical factors remain."
