            "summary": "In the third quarter of 2023, TSMC reported a revenue of USD 16.94 billion, marking a 10.2% sequential increase in U.S. dollars from the second quarter. This growth was primarily driven by the strong ramp-up of TSMC's 3-nanometer technology and increased demand for 5-nanometer technologies, exceeding previous guidance expectations. Initially, a 10% annual decline was anticipated in U.S. dollar terms, but strong demand for N3 technology led to a revised forecast of a high single-digit decline. Management expects continued strong N3 demand into the next year and maintains a long-term revenue growth target of 15% to 20% CAGR from 2021 to 2026.",

To manage our profitability in the next several years, we will work diligently on our internal cost improvement while continuing to strategically sell our value.

Krish, in the past, our leading node normally reach gross margins -- corporate margin in about eight quarters.

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations include:\n\n1. **Ramp-up of N3 Products**: The strong demand and quick ramp-up of N3 products have positively influenced the company's sales expectations. This ramp-up is expected to continue into the next year, indicating a strong future sales pipeline.\n\n2. **New Product Launches**: The introduction of new customer products in the second half of the year is contributing to better-than-expected revenue performance, despite the typical seasonality.\n\n3. **Revenue Growth Targets**: The management has set a target of a 15% to 20% revenue CAGR from 2021 to 2026, which implies a focus on sustaining robust sales growth over the medium term.\n\nPotential risks include:\n\n1. **Smartphone Market Performance**: The smartphone business, which has been underperforming, is expected to rebound to align with corporate growth averages. However, any continued weakness in this segment could pose a risk to overall sales growth.\n\n2. **Seasonality**: While the company has not observed dramatic changes in seasonality, typical seasonal fluctuations could still impact sales, particularly if new product ramps do not fully offset these effects.\n\n3. **Market Conditions**: Broader economic conditions and market demand fluctuations could impact sales, especially in key sectors like smartphones and back-end businesses.\n\nOverall, the company's proactive product strategies and growth targets are key drivers, while market dynamics and segment-specific performances represent potential risks."
