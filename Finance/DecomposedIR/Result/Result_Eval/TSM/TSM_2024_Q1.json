First quarter revenue decreased 5.3% sequentially in NT dollars or 3.8% in U.S. dollars as our business was impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand. Gross margin increased 0.1 percentage point sequentially to 53.1%, mainly reflecting product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality, partially offset by a less favorable foreign exchange rate. Total operating expenses accounted for 11.1% of net revenue, which is lower than the 12% implied in our first quarter guidance, mainly due to tighter expense controls. Thus, operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points sequentially to 42%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD8.7 and ROE was 25.4%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 9% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, whilst 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 37% and 19%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 65% of wafer",

Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 19.6 billion and USD 20.4 billion, which represents a 6% sequential increase or a 27.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD32.3, gross margin is expected to be between 51% and 53%, operating margin between 40% and 42%. Also, in the second quarter, we will need to accrue the tax on the undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be slightly above 19%. The tax rate will then fall back to 13% to 14% level in the third and fourth quarter, and the full year tax rate will be between 15% to 16% compared to 14.5% in 2023.

The gross margin for the quarter was 53.1%, with a slight increase attributed to product mix changes. Advanced technologies, including 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer, and 7-nanometer processes, contributed significantly to revenue, with a combined 65% of wafer revenue. Management noted that the automotive segment's performance is expected to decrease, while N3 revenue is projected to more than triple compared to 2023. Advanced packaging and 3DIC technologies are anticipated to see increased demand in the future.\n\nExplanation: The sales figures highlight the revenue contributions of different segments, with HPC leading.

                    "init_answer": "Based on the earnings call transcript and financial data, the key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations for TSMC include:\n\n1. **Demand Shifts**: There's a noted decrease in the growth forecast for the semiconductor industry, particularly in the smartphone segment, which is experiencing only gradual recovery. Additionally, the automotive platform, previously expected to grow, is now anticipated to decline.\n\n2. **AI vs. Traditional Computing**: There's a significant focus on AI-driven demand, which is impacting traditional server and data center demand. The shift towards AI-centric applications could potentially crowd out demand for traditional CPU-centric servers, affecting sales in those segments.\n\n3. **Gross Margin Pressure**: The N3 (3nm) technology ramp is expected to cause a 3 to 4 percentage point dilution in gross margins in the second half of the year, which could impact profitability if not offset by increased sales volume or cost efficiencies.\n\nThese factors represent both opportunities and risks for TSMC's future sales, with the potential for growth in AI applications counterbalanced by challenges in traditional markets and margin pressures from new technology ramps."
