The company revised its full-year revenue guidance from a low to mid-single-digit decline to a 10% decline due to these macroeconomic challenges.

We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decline by 1.6 percentage points to 52.5% at the midpoint, primarily as the higher level of capacity utilization rate is offset by 2 to 3 percentage points margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology.

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations for TSMC include:\n\n1. **Weaker Market Conditions**: The overall market is weaker than anticipated, with specific mention of the Chinese economy's recovery being slower than expected. This has led to lower-than-expected end-market demand.\n\n2. **Macro-Economic Impact**: The global macroeconomic environment is impacting various market segments, causing a broad-based weakness in demand across applications, except for AI.\n\n3. **AI Demand**: While there is strong demand for AI processors, it is not sufficient to offset the negative impacts from broader market weaknesses. There is also uncertainty about the sustainability and realness of AI demand, as customers are aggressively booking capacity.\n\n4. **Inventory Cycle**: The current inventory cycle is taking longer to resolve compared to previous cycles in 2015 and 2019, raising concerns about the timing of a market recovery.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a cautious outlook, with an expectation of a 10% decline in sales for the year."
