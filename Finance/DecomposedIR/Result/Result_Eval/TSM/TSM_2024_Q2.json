This growth was driven by strong demand for TSMC's advanced three- and five-nanometer technologies, despite seasonal smartphone market fluctuations, aligning with the company's guidance. Management attributed the revenue increase to higher-than-expected capacity utilization and projected third-quarter revenue between USD 22.4 billion and USD 23.2 billion, a 9.5% sequential increase or 32% year-over-year rise, with a focus on maintaining a gross margin of 53% or higher.",

Gross margin increased 10 basis points sequentially to 53.2%, mainly reflecting cost improvement and a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by the margin then from M3 RAM.

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations include:\n\n1. **Advanced Packaging Profitability**: The improvement in gross margin for advanced packaging, approaching the corporate average, indicates a potential increase in profitability, which could drive sales.\n\n2. **Silicon Content and Technology Advancements**: The transition to 5G and increased silicon content in smartphones and PCs are expected to enhance sales, as customers are planning capacities for advanced technologies like five- and three-nanometer processes.\n\n3. **Customer Engagement and Planning**: Early customer engagement in planning for 2025 capacities suggests a strong demand outlook, particularly for high-end technology upgrades.\n\nKey risks include:\n\n1. **Tight Supply Constraints**: The tight supply of advanced nodes like five- and three-nanometer could limit the ability to meet demand, potentially constraining sales growth.\n\n2. **Capacity Expansion Challenges**: Difficulty in expanding capacity for CoWoS (Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate) may impact the ability to support customer growth, posing a risk to future sales.\n\nOverall, while technological advancements and improved profitability in certain segments are positive drivers, supply constraints and capacity expansion challenges remain significant risks."
