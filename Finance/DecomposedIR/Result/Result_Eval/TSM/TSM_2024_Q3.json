The content now we put more AI into their chip, and so the silicon area increase faster than the unique growth. So again, I would like to say that for this PC and smartphone business, not only -- is gradually increased, and we expect it to be healthy in the next few years because of AI-related applications.\\nKrish Sankar : Got it, got it. Very helpful. And then my quick follow-up is, I'm kind of curious, you know, on your packaging side, advanced packaging today is part of the non-wafer revenues. Obviously, we're investing in cobots and other technologies. How do you think about that advanced packaging revenue growth over the next few years, and do you think at some point in the next couple of years, advanced packaging can reach corporate-level growth margins, or would it always be below that? Thank you very much.\\nJeff Su: Okay, thank"

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations for TSMC include:\n\n1. **AI Demand**: The increasing integration of AI into chips, particularly for PCs and smartphones, is expected to drive growth as the silicon area required for AI applications increases faster than the unique unit growth.\n\n2. **Advanced Packaging**: Investments in advanced packaging technologies, such as cobots, could contribute to revenue growth, although there is uncertainty whether these operations will achieve corporate-level growth margins.\n\nRisks include:\n\n1. **Non-AI Demand**: The growth in demand for non-AI related wafer production remains low, with PC and smartphone demand expected to grow only in the low single digits.\n\n2. **Economic Fluctuations**: Any downturn in the global economy could impact consumer demand for electronics, affecting sales.\n\n3. **Technological Changes**: Rapid changes in technology and competition could pose risks if TSMC fails to keep pace with innovation."
