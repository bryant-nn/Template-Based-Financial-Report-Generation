The significant investments in property, plant, and equipment, amounting to around $9.89 billion, align with the company's strategy of high capital expenditures.\n\nComparing these insights with historical performance, the company seems to have been in a phase of heavy investment, likely impacting short-term profitability but positioning itself for future growth.
