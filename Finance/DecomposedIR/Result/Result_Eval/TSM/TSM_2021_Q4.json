We're not prepared to talk about gross margin outlook for the subsequent quarters of the year, but please be reminded that there are six factors affecting our profitabilities. Those factors include the ramp and development of our advanced technology, price, cost, mix, utilization and foreign exchange rate. The foreign exchange rate is something that we cannot control and hard to predict.

You've said in the past that the newest process node will take about seven to eight quarters to reach the corporate average. But now this time, I think one difference about N3 is that you have both smartphone and HPC being supported at the right – at the beginning of the launch of the N3 node. So my guess is that the revenue for smartphone and HPC ramp could really go parallel instead of one after another and which could really help your volume, your revenue. And could you comment on whether that seven to eight quarters of the margin dilution of the newest process node, maybe starting from N3, it will become shorter. That's my question.
