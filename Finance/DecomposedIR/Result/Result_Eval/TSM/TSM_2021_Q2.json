                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations include:\n\n1. **Semiconductor Supply and Demand**: The tight supply and demand dynamics in the semiconductor industry are expected to persist through the end of this year and potentially into the next year, indicating a strong market demand that could drive sales.\n\n2. **China Business Growth**: The significant increase in sales contribution from China, which grew from 6% in Q1 to 11% in Q2, suggests that the Chinese market is a strong growth driver. The potential for maintaining or increasing this contribution to a double-digit percentage of sales is a positive indicator for future sales.\n\n3. **Automotive Semiconductor Market**: The expansion opportunities in the automotive semiconductor market present a significant addressable market for the company, especially given the passive capacity expansion stance of many automotive IDM companies.\n\nRisks include:\n\n1. **Inventory Correction**: There is a concern about a potential inventory correction if customers adjust their inventory levels, which could impact sales negatively.\n\n2. **Capacity Planning and Utilization**: Ensuring capacity planning aligns with long-term market demand is crucial to maintaining utilization and profitability, which directly affects sales expectations."
