Year-on-year, there was a revenue decrease in the Foundry business, reflecting broader demand challenges. Revenue changes were driven by global economic conditions and customer inventory adjustments, weakening demand for mobile and PC products. Despite these challenges, the company focused on high value-added products, improving gross margins.
