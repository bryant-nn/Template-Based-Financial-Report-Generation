The MX division recorded shipments of 58 million smartphones and 7 million tablets in third quarter with a smartphone ASP of $295. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating profit compared to the previous quarter, due to the release of new smartphone, tablet and wearable products. Although material costs rose as product specifications improved to enhance their competitiveness, our expanded sales focused around flagship models drove profitability close to the double-digits.
