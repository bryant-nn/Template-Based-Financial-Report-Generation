To give you a bit more detail, many companies facing macroeconomic uncertainties have been operating conservative investment stands and this has resulted in a reduction in IT spending overall. So we have seen a slowdown of demand especially around servers and storage. Also, customers have been continuing to adjust their inventory to improve their financial conditions. This has lead to a decrease in purchasing demand and this has driven to an additional price decline versus the previous quarter. Price changes are an item that has a direct impact on earnings and so during the first quarter, the additional price decline had a direct impact on our profitability as well.
