The Memory segment saw lower quarter-on-quarter revenue due to decreased ASPs and bit growth below guidance, but year-on-year revenue improved due to increased demand and higher ASPs. The Foundry segment achieved record revenue despite lower quarter-on-quarter profitability, with year-on-year improvements from new operations and price adjustments. The Display segment benefited from strong mobile panel demand but faced challenges with large panels. The MX Business saw a slight revenue increase due to premium product sales, though profits decreased due to marketing costs. The CE Business achieved record revenue from premium product sales, despite a slight profit decline. These changes aligned with the guidance of focusing on premium sales and managing supply and costs. Management attributed revenue deviations to factors like bit growth and market conditions, with a positive future outlook for mobile panels and network business growth.",
