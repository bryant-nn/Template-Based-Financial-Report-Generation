However, there was a slight quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) decline attributed to lower smartphone sales amid weak demand and supply shortages. The YoY growth aligned with previous guidance, driven by strong server-led memory demand, cost reductions in memory, premium product sales, and improved market conditions. Management attributed revenue deviations to exceeding bit growth guidance and unexpected ASP increases, particularly in the memory and display sectors, despite challenges in mobile sales due to supply issues.

I would like to discuss the IM division's Q2 results and outlook for the second half of the year. In Q2 2021, market demand is expected to have decreased quarter-on-quarter due to seasonality and a resurgence of COVID-19. For our mobile business, revenue decreased from the previous quarter due to the component supply constraint in the mobile industry and production issues at our factory in Vietnam. Under these circumstances, we strive to minimize the impacts by prioritizing critical products and regions, utilizing our global SCM capabilities to optimally rebalance supply. Meanwhile, products in our Galaxy ecosystem, including tablets, PCs and wearables, contributed substantially to the Q2 performance.

The dividend will be paid in mid-August. Now I would like to present the results for the second quarter. Total revenue in the second quarter came in at KRW63.7 trillion, down slightly sequentially, mainly due to lower smartphone sales amid seasonally weak demand and component supply shortages. However, we achieved a new all-time high for revenue in a respective quarter for the second quarter in a row where our active response to server-led memory demand and the solid performance of premium home appliances led such results.
