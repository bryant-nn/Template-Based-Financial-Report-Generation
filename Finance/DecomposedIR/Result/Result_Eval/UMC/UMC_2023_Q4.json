YoY, revenue composition shifted with IDM rising from 15% to 22% and Fabless making up 78%. Revenue from 22 and 28 nanometers technologies rose to 36% of total Q4 revenue. The decline in revenue was due to a 27% YoY drop in wafer shipments and a decrease in gross margin from 45.1% to 34.9%. These changes were in line with guidance, which anticipated challenges from lower utilization rates and a strategic shift to advanced nodes. Management attributed revenue deviations to market demand and inventory caution, expecting industry growth in 2024 and aiming to increase utilization and product launches.",

The decrease in gross margin from 45.1% in 2022 to 34.9% in 2023 also contributed to the lower revenue figures.\n\nThis decline aligns with the company's previous guidance, which anticipated challenges due to lower utilization rates.

The net income ratio was 0.7%, and the operating income ratio was 0.7%, indicating modest profitability.\n\nWhile the historical performance in Q4 2023 reflects a stable financial position with healthy cash flows and profitability, the forecasted trends for 2024 suggest cautious optimism due to macroeconomic uncertainties and inventory challenges in specific segments. The anticipated growth aligns with historical stability but is tempered by external factors."

And although we have observed healthier inventory level in PC and smartphone market segment in Q4 ‘23, the customer remain cautious after the Q1 ‘24 restocking of the mobile applications.  For the alto and industrial segment, they will likely require more time to digest the inventory and return back to normal in the second half of the 2023. So overall, the visibility of 2024 is relative limited due to macro uncertainties. And while there is a lingering inventory issue in auto and industrial segment, we are cautiously optimistic about the market demand, given the PC and mobile inventory have returned to a bit healthier level in Q4 ‘23 already. I think customer is behaving little bit cautious after the Q1 restocking, and then we will continue monitoring the market dynamics.\\nOperator: Next one, Bruce Lu of Goldman Sachs.

                        "about overall order visibility into the next few months? Are you starting to see customers come back or you think the customer stance is still a little bit more cautious given some of your other competitors have been starting to talk about utilization, bottoming out and growth kind of resuming? Any thoughts about how you expect growth to look like for the foundry industry this year and also for UMC?\\nJason Wang : Sure. I mean, we start off on the maybe industry. We do expect the 2024, the semi-industry will grow, probably to a mid-single digit year-over-year. But for foundry, we project that it will grow in a high single digit range, and for the UMC, we will strive to grow in line with the foundry industry. Despite that our addressable market will probably remain flattish. As far as the demand outlook of course we start off with the inventory situation. And although we have observed healthier inventory level in PC and smartphone market segment in Q4 ‘23, the customer remain cautious",

I think it was about 30%, 35%, if I remember two, three years back. Is there any update in terms of how much of your product mix is now specialty, and how much of it is single sourced in terms of the total business that you have?\\nJason Wang: There's for the specialty right now is in Q1 is in a high 50 range -- high 50% range. So, the single source product is actually quite high. It's higher than that. However, it is the -- we also have to look in the end market competition. So, some of those product also considered as a commoditized area, and we are gradually moving out from that space. \\nGokul Hariharan: Understood. Thank you. Last question on -- how do you think about overall order visibility into the next few months? Are you starting to see customers come back or you think the customer stance is still a little bit more cautious given some of your other"

However, the auto and industrial segments still face lingering inventory issues that might delay recovery.\n\n2. **Customer Caution**: Customers remain cautious after Q1 2024 restocking, which could affect order volumes and sales growth in the near term.\n\n3. **Market Demand**: There is cautious optimism for market demand as inventory levels in key segments improve, but macroeconomic uncertainties limit visibility into 2024.\n\n4. **Industry Growth**: The semiconductor industry is expected to grow mid-single digits in 2024, with the foundry sector projected to grow in the high single digits. UMC aims to align its growth with the foundry industry.\n\n5. **Product Mix**: A shift towards a higher specialty product mix (high 50% range) could drive sales, although some products are moving out of commoditized areas.\n\nRisks include macroeconomic uncertainties, continued inventory digestion in certain segments, and cautious customer behavior affecting order visibility and growth."
