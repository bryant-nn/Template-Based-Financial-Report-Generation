Revenue for the first three quarters grew by 17% to NT$ 153.9 billion. Management expects continued growth, anticipating the foundry industry to grow in double digits with UMC outpacing this growth, despite some market softness.\n\nExplanation: The revenue growth was attributed to increased wafer shipments, better loadings, and higher ASPs, consistent with the company's guidance and expectations. The 9.8% QoQ growth and 17% increase over the first three quarters reflect these factors, supporting future growth expectations.",

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations for UMC include the structural demand in sectors such as 5G, electric vehicles (EV), and the Internet of Things (IoT), which remain strong despite some observed market softness. UMC anticipates that these demands will continue to contribute significantly to their growth. Additionally, the company expects to outpace the foundry industry's growth rate of 12% due to capacity increases, productivity improvements, and maintaining strong average selling price (ASP) momentum into 2022.\n\nOn the risk side, UMC is monitoring potential risks related to inventory levels, including both excess inventory and component shortages, which could impact sales. The company is also aware of the cyclical nature of the market and is positioning its ASP strategy for long-term partnerships rather than short-term profit exploitation, which could mitigate some cyclical risks."
