However, the demand in the auto segment remains soft.\n\n2. **Product Mix and Pricing**: A stable pricing strategy is maintained, with changes in blended ASP due to shifts in product mix. This indicates a focus on higher-margin products rather than commoditized segments.\n\n3. **Customer Inventory Management**: Customers are being prudent in managing their inventory, which may lead to a seasonal Q4 and a potential return to normalcy in 2025 as outsourced inventory levels stabilize.\n\n4. **Market Dynamics**: While there is a mild recovery anticipated in 2024, there is no sign of a strong rebound, suggesting cautious optimism about future sales growth.\n\n5. **Technological Engagement**: Engagement with clients on potential design and technology adoption for future growth indicates a strategic focus on capturing future semiconductor needs.\n\nRisks include:\n\n1. **Weak Auto Demand**: Continued softness in the auto segment could dampen overall sales growth.\n\n2. **Inventory Correction Cycle**: The ongoing inventory correction cycle might delay recovery in demand.\n\n3. **Limited Visibility**: Limited visibility into future product design cycles poses a risk to accurately forecasting future sales."
