            "summary": "In Q1 2022, UMC's revenue increased by 7.3% QoQ and 35% YoY. This growth was driven by a higher average selling price (ASP), improved gross margins from 39.1% to 43.4%, and strong demand, particularly in sectors like automotive, networking, and cloud. The actual YoY growth of 35% exceeded the 20% growth guidance from 2021 Q4, reflecting effective pricing strategies, cost management, and stronger-than-anticipated market conditions. Despite macroeconomic challenges, management remains confident in sustaining growth due to robust demand in key sectors.",

This growth was primarily driven by a better Average Selling Price (ASP) and an improvement in the gross margin rate from 39.1% to 43.4%.\n\n- **Revenue Growth YoY (Year-over-Year):** Revenue grew by 35% compared to the same period in the previous year.
