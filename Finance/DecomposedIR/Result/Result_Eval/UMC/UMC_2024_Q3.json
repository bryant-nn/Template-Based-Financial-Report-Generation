Although specific YoY figures aren't provided, cumulative revenue for the first three quarters of 2024 grew by 2.6% compared to 2023. The revenue increase aligns with guidance, driven by higher Asian market contributions, improved communication segment performance, record revenue from the 22 to 28 nanometer technology nodes, and better capacity utilization. These factors offset declines in the European market and the computer segment. Future expectations include a slightly improved Q4 revenue outlook, with anticipated challenges impacting gross margins.",

This shift indicates a stronger performance in the Asian market.\n\n2. **Segment Performance**: The communication segment experienced an increase from 39% to 42%, which positively impacted overall revenue. However, the computer segment saw a decline from 15% to 13%, which partially offset the gains from the communication segment.\n\n3. **Technology Node Revenue**: Revenue from the 22 to 28 nanometer technology nodes reached a record high of 35%, indicating strong demand and sales in this segment. Meanwhile, the 40 nanometer segment remained stable at 13%.\n\n4. **Capacity Utilization**: The capacity utilization rate improved slightly from 68% to 71%, supporting increased production and sales volumes.\n\n5. **CapEx Adjustments**: The revision of the annual CapEx budget from NT$3.3 billion to NT$3 billion reflects an updated schedule for capacity expansion, particularly in Singapore, which may have implications for future revenue growth.\n\nOverall, the revenue changes align with previous guidance, where a slight improvement in the computing segment was expected, offset by a mild decline in the communication and consumer segments.

What's the reason behind? And looking ahead, if based on 30% or high utilization rate, what will be a reasonable gross margin range that we should expect?\\nChi-Tung Liu: So for the Q4 margin, lower guidance is largely due to a lower capacity utilization rate, the high 50% versus 71% in Q3. Also, the NT dollar is a headwind because of NT$32.29 was the average ForEx we use in the previous quarter. And this quarter, I think, at least in the beginning, even shoot up to nearly NT$31.5 per $1. And also, the higher depreciation arise from capacity expansion. This factor is going to impact us for relatively few",

So it's very difficult for us to commit the absolute numbers. So what Jason just mentioned is there are several headwinds coming. And we also work diligently to offset the impact. So overall, we do believe our structure profitability should be intact. And especially for year 2025 and '26, we will focus more on our EBITDA margin, which really has no major reason will be different materially compared to the previous down cycle.\\nLaura Chen: Okay, very clear.

Gross margin is anticipated to decrease from 34% in Q3 to 30% in Q4 due to lower capacity utilization, adverse foreign exchange impacts, and increased depreciation from capacity expansion.
