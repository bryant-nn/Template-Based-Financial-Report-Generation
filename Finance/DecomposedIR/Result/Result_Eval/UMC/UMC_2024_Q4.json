Yes.\\nSunny Lin: Got it. No problem. Another question on gross margin. Q4 revenue is guided to be flat. ASP is also flat. But you anticipate gross margin to fall to 30% from 34% in Q3. What's the reason behind? And looking ahead, if based on 30% or high utilization rate, what will be a reasonable gross margin range that we should expect?\\nChi-Tung Liu: So for the Q4 margin, lower guidance is largely due to a lower capacity utilization rate, the high 50% versus 71% in Q3. Also, the NT dollar is a headwind because of NT$32.29 was the average ForEx we use in the previous quarter. And this quarter, I think, at least in the beginning, even shoot up to nearly NT$31.5 per $1. And also, the higher depreciation arise from capacity expansion. This factor is going to impact us for relatively few",

So overall, we do believe our structure profitability should be intact. And especially for year 2025 and '26, we will focus more on our EBITDA margin, which really has no major reason will be different materially compared to the previous down cycle.\\nLaura Chen: Okay, very clear.

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations include:\n\n1. **Inventory Levels**: Inventory levels in the communication, consumer, and computing segments have normalized, which could lead to more stable demand. However, the automotive and industrial segments are expected to take until the end of Q2 2025 to return to normal levels, which may affect sales in these areas.\n\n2. **Market Demand and Seasonality**: Once inventory levels normalize, demand is expected to follow market seasonality, potentially leading to fluctuations in sales based on seasonal trends.\n\n3. **Wafer Shipments**: There is an expectation of increased wafer shipments in 2025, which could drive sales growth if demand materializes as anticipated.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements**: The company's investment in technology development, such as the 22 nanometer display driver solution, positions it to support next-generation products, potentially boosting sales.\n\n5. **Customer Forecasts**: Current customer forecasts remain conservative despite signs of global economic recovery, indicating potential risk if demand does not pick up as expected.\n\n6. **Pricing Dynamics**: The company offered a 4% ASP reset earlier in the year to support customers, and there is uncertainty about pricing stabilization, which could impact future sales. \n\nOverall, while there are positive indicators such as technological advancements and normalized inventory levels in some segments, conservative customer forecasts and ongoing inventory digestion in other segments pose risks to future sales expectations."
