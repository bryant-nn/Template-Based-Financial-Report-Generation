However, year-over-year, revenue for the first half of 2023 declined by 18.4% to TWD110.5 billion, influenced by softer end-market demand and macroeconomic challenges. These results aligned with previous guidance, which anticipated stable wafer shipments and a utilization rate of 71%. Despite these gains, management remains cautious due to ongoing inventory and demand concerns, as well as rising operational costs.",

Rising costs are expected to erode gross margins further by low single-digit percentage points, suggesting a potential decline in profitability compared to previous periods.\n\nThe company is maintaining confidence in its 28-nanometer technology due to its diverse applications and customer base, which may help mitigate some of the negative impacts.
