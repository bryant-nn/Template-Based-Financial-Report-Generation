                    "init_answer": "The key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations include:\n\n1. **End Market Dynamics**: The company is cautiously optimistic about the rest of the year, anticipating that Q1 2024 could be the bottom. However, there is uncertainty regarding the overall macroeconomic outlook, which could impact end market dynamics, particularly in the smartphone supply chain where inventory de-stocking is occurring.\n\n2. **Technology Node Demand**: There is an expectation of growth in wafer demand for consumer and computer applications, while the automotive and industrial segments remain soft due to ongoing inventory digestion. Demand for 28 and 22 nanometer technology nodes is expected to gradually improve, whereas mature nodes like 40 and 65 nanometers are expected to remain flat.\n\n3. **Cost Pressures**: The company is facing headwinds from cost increases, including 2D cost, inflationary pressures, and depreciation costs. These factors are challenges to maintaining profitability and could influence sales if not managed effectively.\n\n4. **Utilization Rates**: The company has been operating with a utilization rate below 70%, indicating potential underutilization of capacity, which could affect future sales if demand does not increase as anticipated.\n\nOverall, the company's future sales expectations are influenced by market trends, technology demand, cost management, and macroeconomic factors."
