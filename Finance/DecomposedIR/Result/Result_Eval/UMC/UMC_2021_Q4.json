Key factors contributing to this growth included an increase in the 22/28-nanometer technology segment from 14% to 20% of total revenue, and growth in the computer and consumer segments. This performance aligned with UMC's guidance, driven by demand in sectors like 5G, EV, and IoT. Management expects continued growth in 2022, aiming for UMC to become a $10 billion-plus company.",

Firstly, there was a significant increase in the 22/28-nanometer technology segment, which rose from 14% of total revenue in the previous year to 20% in 2021. This increase contributed positively to the overall blended average selling price (ASP). Additionally, the computer and consumer segments each grew by 3 percentage points, reaching 17% and 27% of total revenue, respectively, compared to the previous year. The communication segment remained stable at 46% of the revenue pie.\n\nOverall, UMC's revenue grew by 20.5% year-over-year in NT dollar terms and approximately 26-27% in US dollar terms due to the stronger NT dollar appreciation against the US dollar.

We do see some of the wafer demand associated with the work from home and home learning as the softness. And the -- on the smartphone side, we also see the -- some softness, but the overall smartphone probably are flattish, kind of the lower end side. But we do expect the 5G smartphone, the penetration, will still continue. The automotive will continue. And we see a lots of activity on IoT space, too. So those will easily offset the softness. So I think at this point, we believe the demand will remain robust. If we talk about the near term, I think that for us this year, there are a few challenges, such as Omicron's case, only for tools and equipment we talked about earlier and also innovation, right? So for this year, we'll be focused on working closely with our -- both upstream and downstream partners to ensure the supply, the loading and the managing the cost issue. So",

So for this year, we'll be focused on working closely with our -- both upstream and downstream partners to ensure the supply, the loading and the managing the cost issue. So I'm less concerned about the demand for the year, but I'm more focused on the overall, the other factors, yes.\\nCharlie Chan: Okay. Just one very quick follow-up, and I will be back to the queue. So regarding the kind of tech supply chain-inventory assumption, your -- in terms of peers, that the supply chain needs to keep a very, very high inventory probably given the logistics issue, right? But our concern is that for consumer tech, the inventory value could discount, I mean, the products or the kind of chip components. So in your kind of full year assumption, do you consider timing of inventory correction? Or you think this year - through the year, we wouldn't see a kind of inventory rebalancing for the tech supply chain?\\nJason Wang: Well, I mean, the - for the inventory level, right, we",
                        "that as a consideration. So for that - so for some of those consideration, our auto revenue portion will actually continue to increase. .\\nFrank Lee: Thank you.\\nOperator: And next, we have Sunny Lin, UBS, for questions. Go ahead please.\\nSunny Lin: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats on the very strong performance. My first question is for next couple of years. Clearly, there's constructive demand drivers for turning edge. But several foundries are expanding and China is also accelerating the investment. So I wanted to get your thought on how overall supply-demand dynamics could trend next couple of years?\\nJason Wang: We - earlier, we kind of touched about the demand. So it's -- our market intelligence lead us to believe that the demand will continue to be strong because of those mega trends reason. On the supply side, based on the announced capacity expansion plan, we do see the oversupply situation at 28-nanometer to happen beyond 2023, not before 2023. But we still"

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers influencing future sales expectations include strong demand for 5G smartphones, automotive technology, and IoT applications. These sectors are expected to offset any softness observed in consumer tech and PC markets. Additionally, the company anticipates robust demand due to mega trends, despite potential oversupply in the 28-nanometer segment beyond 2023.\n\nRisks include logistics issues affecting inventory levels, potential inventory rebalancing in the tech supply chain, and challenges related to Omicron's impact on tools and equipment availability. The company is focusing on managing supply chain and cost issues by collaborating closely with upstream and downstream partners."
