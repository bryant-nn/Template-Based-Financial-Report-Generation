The decline was driven by an 18% decrease in wafer shipments, particularly in mobile and consumer markets, partially offset by a 12% increase in average selling prices per wafer. This aligns with the company's guidance from Q4 2022, which anticipated Q1 as the lowest revenue point of the year due to high inventory levels and weak demand, with expectations of sequential growth as inventories normalize.",

Next, let me provide you with our outlook for the second quarter. We expect total GF revenue to be between $1.81 billion and $1.85 billion. Of this, we expect non-wafer revenue to be approximately 10% of total revenue. We expect adjusted gross profit to be between $498 million and $527 million.

As discussed in our fourth quarter results, we expect to see a continued ramp across our processing, sensing, connectivity, and vehicle infrastructures technologies throughout 2023. We have and will continue to allocate more of our existing capacity as well as add additional capacity to support the continued growth of silicon content within the automotive market.

ASP increased approximately 12% year-over-year, driven by ramping long-term customer agreements with better pricing, as well as continued improvement in product mix. Wafer revenue from our end markets accounted for approximately 87% of total revenue. Non-wafer revenue, which includes revenue from radicals, non-recurring engineering, expedite fees, and other items accounted for approximately 13% of total revenue for the first quarter, broadly consistent with our expectations. Let me now provide an update on our revenues by end markets. Smart mobile devices represented approximately 38% of the quarter's total revenue. First quarter revenue declined 29% from the prior year period, principally driven by reduced volumes in the low-to-mid tier smartphone segments and a continuation of the well-publicized inventory correction within the broader smart mobile market.

That stated I would like to add a little bit more context. When you think about 2022 or the year of 2022, we ran utilization in the very high 90%s for the entire year almost 100% for the entire year.

In the first quarter, GF revenue declined 5% year-over-year and 12% sequentially with reduced wafer shipments being partially offset by year-over-year improvements in ASP and mix. Coupled with strong operational execution, this resulted in a resilient adjusted gross margin for the quarter, as we continue to proactively manage our costs to help offset the broader industry headwinds. We reported adjusted gross margin of 28.5% in the quarter, and we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.52, which were at the high end of our guidance range.
