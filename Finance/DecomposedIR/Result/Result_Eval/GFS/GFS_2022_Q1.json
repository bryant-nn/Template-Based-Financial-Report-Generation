            "summary": "In Q1 2022, the company achieved approximately $1.94 billion in revenue, marking a 37% year-over-year increase. This growth was driven by a 14% increase in wafer shipments and a 19% rise in average selling prices due to favorable pricing conditions and long-term customer agreements. Wafer revenue made up 90% of total revenue, with non-wafer revenue at 10%. The results exceeded previous guidance, highlighting stronger-than-expected performance. Management attributed revenue deviations to variability in non-wafer revenue components and maintained a positive outlook despite minor variability risks, projecting non-wafer revenue to decrease to 8.5% in Q2 2022.",

You've got weak China domestic smartphone demand which is impacting the low end of the segment. So on the strong June quarter guidance, Tom, given the commentary around weakness in mobile, so is your mobile business sustaining sequentially, given the supply demand gap by some of the customers in those segments or is your mobile business weaker sequentially in the June quarter, and it's just the diversification in the business is just allowing you guys to reallocate capacity to your non-auto segments where we know that demand is still strongly outstripping supply?\\nThomas Caulfield: I think we've got flat in sequentially in the kind of the high end handset in that space.

When I mentioned 2% of total revenue, it is really the impact on the P&L itself. So in other words how much impact would that have at the margins at the bottom. And so really, we were just communicating that, as we had set up all these LTAs and contemplated these contracts, we were working in the background to lock in the materials at fixed volumes, fixed prices. We were working on variability in our labor pay, and of course, we were hedging against some of the commodity exposure that we have on input prices, into your energy sources.

So there is a lot of engineering that actually goes into that segment of the process, as well as the NRE line. That's the non-recurring engineering line.

Dave will discuss in more detail our financials later in his commentary. But first, let me provide a summary of our first quarter revenue by end markets, starting with smart mobile devices. Smart mobile devices represented approximately 50% of first quarter revenue and it grew 28% year-over-year. This growth was primarily driven by the continued transition of the market for more feature rich handsets, which is happening concurrently with the transition to 5G connectivity.

One, let me just provide some clarification. ASPs year-over-year we're up 19% and volume was up 14% and that's specifically first quarter 2022 to first quarter 2021.
