            "summary": "In Q4 2022, GlobalFoundries' total revenue for the year was approximately $8.1 billion, marking a 23% year-over-year increase. Wafer and non-wafer revenues comprised about 88% and 12% of the total, respectively. Key segments such as automotive and communications infrastructure saw significant YoY growth of 24% and 27%, respectively. The revenue changes were driven by modest growth in average selling prices (ASPs) and a predicted volume recovery in the year's second half, aligning with previous guidance of exceeding twice the growth rate from 2022 to 2023. Management anticipates the first half of the year, especially the first quarter, to be the revenue trough, with recovery expected later due to customer demand and long-term agreements.",

Fourth quarter revenue grew about 24% year-over-year, representing approximately 5% of the quarter's total revenue. Growth was driven by a strong ramp across our automotive processing, sensing and vehicle infrastructure technologies. Full-year automotive revenue grew about 30% year-over-year in 2022 and we expect continued growth in 2023. Based on our current design wins and ramp profile, we now expect almost $1 billion of automotive revenue in 2023. Next, our communications infrastructure and data center end market, where fourth quarter revenue grew approximately 27% year-over-year and comprised approximately 18% of the quarter's total revenue driven by a combination of better ASPs and mix as well as higher volume. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased network infrastructure and data center processing demand.",

For the full-year 2022, revenue grew 43% year-over-year, driven by increased edge to data center communication traffic 4G and 5G deployment, as well as overall increased demand for data center capacity. Like most other end markets, we expect data center demand to decline in the first half of 2023. Finally, our personal compute end market was flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter and comprised approximately 5% of the quarter's total revenue. For fiscal year 2022, year-over-year revenue declined approximately 38%. We expect this end market to continue to decline in 2023. As communicated in our third quarter update, we recognize the need to undertake a proactive assessment of our cost base in response to the industry's inventory correction, as well as macroeconomic and inflationary headwinds."

This indicates strong demand and potentially higher value-added products being sold.\n\nAdditionally, two-thirds of the company's revenue in 2022 came from single-source revenue, which suggests a strong reliance on specific customer relationships and potentially a higher demand for unique or specialized wafer solutions.

While specific margin levels for these segments were not detailed, the overall gross margin was 30.1%, with expectations of a decrease to 28% in Q1. Management highlighted the Automotive segment's strong growth trajectory, projecting nearly $1 billion in revenue for 2023, driven by current design wins and ramp profiles.

                        "about 150 basis points above their expectations were - I was wondering, Dave, if you could give us some of the puts and takes? And from what you're describing, seems Q2 revenue could be kind of at least flattish? And then if that is a scenario, then can gross margins continue to go up? Or is there anything on the utilization side or anything else that we should keep in mind to think of a gross margin trajectory for this year?\\nDave Reeder: Sure. Good morning, Vivek. I think when you think about gross margin, you obviously think about two big elements. One is ASP, which as we mentioned, we believe ‘23 will have modest ASP growth over 2022. And then the second element is really what you touched upon, which is utilization. So, in the fourth quarter, utilization was in the mid-90s. For first quarter, we believe utilization is going to be, call it, the mid-ish-80s to perhaps the high-80s from a utilization perspective. And we previously talked about how every -- about every 5 points",
                        "we believe that that will be the driver for increased gross margin will be that utilization figure in that absorption. Did you have a follow-up?\\nVivek Arya: Yes, thanks. Second question is just in the premium smartphone segment, what's your view of how much of your customers’ component inventory is in the premium smartphone segment. Do you think Q1 is where it kind of clears out? Or do you think there could be a little bit that persists into Q2 and then there is a seasonal back half assumption? Just curious, if specifically in the premium smartphone segment, do you think we get to a supply demand balance exiting Q1? Or it could take until Q2 for that to happen?\\nDave Reeder: I think if you were to maybe be a little bit more granular and look at it perhaps a bit on a monthly basis, we think some of that inventory starts to get cleared out towards the end of first quarter, so call it in the March period and maybe it rolls over a little bit into the second quarter, maybe April, perhaps",
                        "first quarter, we believe utilization is going to be, call it, the mid-ish-80s to perhaps the high-80s from a utilization perspective. And we previously talked about how every -- about every 5 points utilization was about 2 points of gross margin from a mathematical perspective, that’s without necessarily taking a lot of actions. So I think sequentially what you're seeing is, you're seeing us move from about 30% gross margin in the fourth quarter moving to a midpoint in the first quarter of about 28%. And so, what you're seeing from us is you're seeing us actually make progress towards that gross margin bridge, but obviously it's being offset a little bit based upon the utilization. So as utilizations improve throughout the year and as we mentioned, we think first half is the bottom, then we believe that that will be the driver for increased gross margin will be that utilization figure in that absorption. Did you have a follow-up?\\nVivek Arya: Yes, thanks. Second question is just in"
