Let me now provide an update on our revenues by end markets. Smart mobile devices represented approximately 42% of the quarter's total revenue. Second quarter revenue increased approximately 13% sequentially but declined roughly 19% from the prior year period principally driven by reduced volumes in the low to mid-tier smartphone segments and a continuation of the well-publicized inventory correction within the broader smart mobile market.  Despite these reduced volumes, ASP and mix was flat year-over-year, which can be partially attributed to the framework and pricing certainty provided under our LTAs. During the second quarter, shipment volumes increased sequentially, which was primarily due to increased demand for our RF transceiver standalone and SoC solutions into premium tier handsets.

And then if I could just touch briefly on our longer-term gross margin roadmap, which I know you remember well from both pre-IPO as well as Capital Markets Day. If you recall from those roadshows and from that Capital Markets Day, we put together a pretty specific model and a bridge to go from where we were at the time to our long-term gross margin model of 40%. And from a gross margin perspective, barring the current utilization headwinds that we're seeing today, we're actually ahead of that model.

This question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. \\nChris Danely : Just another couple of questions on the gross margins going forward. Have your pricing assumptions changed at all in the last three months for 2023/2024? And if we keep the mid-50s utilization rate going forward, is there any risk that your inventory becomes too high because it jumped up sequentially? So wouldn't we",

It could be better cost absorption. It could be better pricing that you receive from suppliers. Those would all kind of broadly fall under the category of manufacturing variance, and we received some better-than-expected manufacturing variance in the second quarter.  So in the absence of that benefit, we would have been at the high end of our second quarter guidance range. So we don't really expect that manufacturing variance to kind of continue throughout the second half of this year, and so we reflected that in our guidance accordingly.
