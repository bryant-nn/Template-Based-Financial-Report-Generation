Our fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of the financial range we provided in our last earnings call. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $1.85 billion, which increased 9% sequentially, driven by higher wafer shipments, ASPs and non-wafer revenue. We shipped approximately 622,300 millimeter equivalent wafers in the quarter, an increase of about 2% on a sequential basis. ASP per wafer increased approximately 3% sequentially, driven by ramping LTAs with better pricing and overall very constructive transactional pricing environment and continued improvement in product mix. Wafer revenue from our end markets accounted for approximately 89% of total revenue. Non-wafer revenue which includes revenue from reticles nonrecurring engineering, expedite fees and other items, accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue for the fourth quarter,",

Our fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of the financial range we provided in our last earnings call.

We shipped approximately 622,300 millimeter equivalent wafers in the quarter, an increase of about 2% on a sequential basis. ASP per wafer increased approximately 3% sequentially, driven by ramping LTAs with better pricing and overall very constructive transactional pricing environment and continued improvement in product mix.

Thanks.\\nTom Caulfield: Well, let's talk first the IoT market. As we sat there in 2021, we had shipped 10 billion IoT devices as an industry. And we did that in 10 years. It took 40 years for PCs to ship 10 billion units, and it took 40 years for handsets to actually ship that kind of volume. And that IoT growth is going to give you 30 billion units over the next three to five years depending on your outlook.

John we talked really about three things that were happening to drive our margins. We talked about this disciplined CapEx and partnership investment that would lead to normalization of depreciation, as well as improved fixed cost absorption. We've talked about the constructive pricing environment and our increasing percentage of single-source business, driven by the differentiation in our business as being something that helps capture margin.

And so with those three points as a backdrop, let me talk about the geographic regions and the individual factories. So let's start with Singapore first. Singapore is our largest campus.

Tom I want to go back to one of the topics you hit on in the preamble about the supply coming on and how fast the industry needed to grow the supply to meet up to the demand and that disconnect. If I look at kind of the broad-based lagging edge companies, whether they're IDMs or fab-lite companies, their spending is exploding. Texas Instruments talked about it last week. So, as those companies are spending two, three times their 10-year average rate, do you view that as more of an endorsement of the growth of the industry, or are you in any way scared that that supply could lead to pricing declines pressure on your customers? I know you have the long-term agreements, but just wondering how you reconcile these companies that aren't necessarily your customers also spending so aggressively?\\nTom Caulfield: Yes, remember they have to grow their business too.
