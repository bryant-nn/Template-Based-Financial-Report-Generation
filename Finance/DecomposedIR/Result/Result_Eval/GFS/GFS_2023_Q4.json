However, these levels remain elevated across most of the end markets we serve as the macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical uncertainties persist.

This suggests a general decline in wafer demand across customer segments.\n\n2. **Flat ASP for the Year**: While the average selling price (ASP) per wafer decreased by approximately 7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to changes in product mix, ASPs for the full year remained flat compared to 2022.

However, revenue from this segment declined approximately 2% sequentially and 7% from the prior year period, driven by reduced shipments. This reflects weaker demand in the smart mobile devices market.\n\n4. **Customer Adjustments**: The fourth quarter results included $79 million of revenue related to customers' adjustments of their near-term contracted volume requirements, indicating variability and potential reductions in demand from key customers.\n\nOverall, the trends suggest a challenging environment with reduced wafer demand, particularly in the smart mobile devices segment, and flat pricing year-over-year despite a decline in shipments."

Moving now to automotive, which as Tom outlined has been a key growth segment for us throughout 2023. Fourth quarter revenue represented approximately 17%, Revenue for the quarter increased approximately 5% sequentially and roughly 177% year-over-year principally due to higher ASP and mix dynamics as semiconductor content and features increased across the vehicle architecture.
