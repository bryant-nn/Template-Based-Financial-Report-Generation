Second quarter revenue increased approximately 12% sequentially and decreased approximately 3% from the prior-year period, principally due to modestly lower shipments. This decline was partially offset by an improvement in ASP and mix, driven by continued content growth in premium tier smart mobile devices. As Tom discussed, we believe that inventory levels in this end market have begun to normalize during the first half of 2024, and we are well positioned to support our customers when this end market rebounds as the silicon content and features and smart mobile devices continues to grow.

And we've been delivering on that. And that's where we expect to be for fiscal 2024. I did note previously in this call the possibility for some modest improvement in fourth quarter gross margin.

And given the relatively high level of fixed costs in our cost structure, that has a meaningful effect on our all-in gross margin that we report.

I want to give the team a lot of credit for the work they've done there.

In 2023, the company achieved $1 billion in automotive revenue, representing a threefold increase compared to 2022. This growth underscores a continued gain in market share within the automotive sector.\n\n2. **Consumer Electronics:** The consumer electronics industry is influenced by macroeconomic conditions in major economies like China and the US. In China, a real estate overhang is leading consumers to save more, while in the US, high interest rates due to inflation are affecting consumer spending. Management anticipates that normalization in these economies could redirect consumer spending back into electronics, boosting business performance.\n\n3. **AI-Enabled Devices:** AI-enabled devices are seen as a potential catalyst for near-term growth. Management is optimistic that new functionalities in AI devices could spark consumer interest and drive demand in the electronics segment.\n\n4. **IoT Market:** There is an expectation for a longer-term recovery in the IoT market, although specific details on performance were not provided.\n\n5. **Gross Margin Concerns:** Despite rising revenues, there is a concern about falling gross margins. Management is addressing this issue and expects the trend to continue into the next quarter. They are working on reconciling this discrepancy to ensure that revenues and gross margins move in a similar direction eventually.\n\nOverall, the management is optimistic about the automotive segment and sees potential in AI-enabled devices while acknowledging challenges in consumer electronics due to macroeconomic factors."
