This ensures a steady demand from the automotive sector, contributing to future sales growth.\n\n2. **Pricing Environment**: The pricing environment is expected to remain stable, with prices projected to be flat year-on-year from 2023 to 2024. This stability is supported by the company's differentiated business model and the single-source nature of a large fraction of its revenue.\n\n3. **Growth in Automotive Sector**: Despite quarterly fluctuations, the automotive sector is expected to show meaningful growth in the mid- to high-single digits in 2024. This growth is supported by a strong order book and business plans.\n\n4. **Product Mix and Seasonality**: Changes in quarterly sales are primarily driven by product mix rather than price changes, reflecting the company's ability to adapt to market demands.\n\nRisks that could influence future sales expectations include:\n\n1. **Dependence on Third-Party Designs**: The company's reliance on third-party customers for product design could pose a risk if these partners face challenges or change their strategies.\n\n2. **Market Cycles**: In markets with quicker product life cycles, there is a reduced need for long-term agreements, which might affect the stability of sales in those segments.\n\n3. **Economic Conditions**: Broader economic conditions could impact demand across various sectors, potentially affecting sales forecasts.\n\nOverall, the company's strategy of securing long-term agreements, particularly in the automotive sector, and maintaining a stable pricing environment are key drivers for future sales growth, while dependence on third-party designs and market volatility pose potential risks."
