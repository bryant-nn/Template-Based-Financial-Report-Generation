Year-over-year, there was substantial growth across key markets: smart mobile grew by 45%, communications infrastructure and data centers by over 30%, Home and Industrial IoT by 37%, and automotive nearly quadrupled. These results aligned with previous guidance, reaching or exceeding the high end of projected financial ranges. Wafer shipments increased by 2.5% sequentially, contributing to 92% of the total revenue, with non-wafer revenue making up the remaining 8%. Management attributed revenue changes to market demand and strategic customer agreements, with future growth expectations tempered by current capacity limitations.",

Moving on to Home and Industrial IoT end market, third quarter revenue was roughly 13% of the total and grew approximately 37% year-over-year.

Margin levels varied across segments, with higher margins associated with more differentiated and complex products, such as those in the infrastructure and automotive sectors. Management noted that the Smart Mobile segment, while stable, is expected to remain flat, whereas the Automotive segment is anticipated to grow significantly from its current base, driven by design wins and partnerships. The Communications and Infrastructure Data Center segments showed strong sequential growth, reflecting positive macro trends, while the Home and Industrial IoT segments also experienced meaningful growth.

Moving on to Home and Industrial IoT end market, third quarter revenue was roughly 13% of the total and grew approximately 37% year-over-year.

First, in our smart mobile end market, which comprise roughly 50% of our third quarter revenue, we saw strong year-over-year growth of roughly 45%, driven mostly by the continued ramp of our single-source design wins in the growing markets such as 5G RF front-end modules for mobile handsets, for image sensors and WiFi 6.
