While the exact ASP figures are not provided, this revenue decline suggests downward pressure on ASP due to reduced demand. The gross margin also decreased by 2.2 percentage points to 54.1%, reflecting lower capacity utilization and higher electricity costs, which can influence ASP.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance:**\n   - The semiconductor industry has been experiencing fluctuations due to global economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, and varying demand across sectors such as automotive and consumer electronics. TSMC's customers are adjusting inventories, further affecting demand and ASP.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends:**\n   - The reduced demand and lower capacity utilization are key factors contributing to the ASP pressure. However, TSMC's cost control measures and favorable foreign exchange rates have helped mitigate some of these effects. Compared to previous quarters, this indicates a cyclical downturn in the industry, impacting ASP.\n\n4. **Future Expectations:**\n   - The transcript suggests that TSMC is optimistic about increasing front-end demand driven by AI and other advanced technologies. This could positively influence ASP in the future. Additionally, TSMC is expanding its advanced packaging capabilities, which may enhance value-added services and potentially improve ASP in subsequent quarters.\n\nIn summary, TSMC's wafer ASP has faced downward pressure due to reduced demand and lower capacity utilization, but cost control and exchange rate benefits have provided some relief.

And then conversely, or is there a risk that we are over expanding or overcapacity risk for the packaging side?\\nC. C. Wei: Okay, Laura. Let me answer the question. AI today is a very hot topic. A lot of my customers right now increase their demand, and that will increase their front end demand, of course. TSMC almost have the major share or the largest share, let me say that in the front end wafer. According to the front ends adopting [ph] we really work closely with our customer and to decide what is the back end that they need.

Despite a sequential revenue decline of 6.2% in U.S. dollars, the company's focus on advanced technologies like 3-nanometer processes indicates a strategic shift towards higher-value segments.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**:\n   - The company's gross margin decreased to 54.1%, down by 2.2 percentage points sequentially, primarily due to lower capacity utilization and higher electricity costs. This reflects the broader economic challenges and inventory adjustments impacting the semiconductor industry.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**:\n   - The increase in AI-related demand is driven by the rising adoption of AI technologies across various industries, necessitating more advanced and efficient semiconductor solutions. However, this demand is not sufficient to offset cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market, attributed to global economic conditions and slower demand recovery in key regions like China.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance**:\n   - TSMC maintains its forecast for a mid-single-digit decline in the semiconductor market (excluding memory) for 2023. However, it expects the foundry industry to decline by mid-teens, with its own revenue projected to decrease by around 10% in U.S. dollar terms. The company anticipates a healthier inventory level for fabless semiconductors by the end of Q3 2023, although customers are likely to remain cautious into Q4 2023.\n\nBy integrating these elements, the analysis provides a clearer picture of how wafer demand trends are impacting TSMC's financial performance and strategic outlook."

However, specific factors driving this growth are not detailed in the transcript.\n\n**Reasoning for Trends**: The absence of specific segment guidance suggests that the company might be focusing on overall growth strategies or dealing with market uncertainties that prevent detailed segment predictions. The sequential revenue increase indicates positive momentum, possibly driven by market recovery, inventory adjustments, or customer demand.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance**: While the transcript does not provide segment-specific guidance, the overall positive revenue outlook suggests that the company expects favorable market conditions or successful strategic initiatives in the upcoming period. Broader market trends, such as technological advancements or macroeconomic factors, could also play a role in this anticipated growth."

Three months ago, we probably - probably more optimistic, but now it's not. Also that is - for example, China economyâ€™s recovery is actually also weaker than what we thought. And so the end market demand actually did not grow as we expected. So put all together, even we have a very good AIs processor demand is still not enough to offset all those kinds of macro impact.

So Gokul's second question is about the inventory correction cycle. He notes this cycle seems to be taking much longer to get through as compared to 2019 and/or 2015.

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for TSMC indicate a projected decline in market performance, expecting a minus 10% for the year. This outlook is primarily influenced by weaker-than-expected demand in key markets, particularly China, and a prolonged inventory correction cycle. Historically, down cycles like those in 2019 and 2015 were shorter, with quicker recoveries. The current cycle's extended duration suggests a more gradual recovery in 2024 rather than a strong rebound.\n\nFrom the financial statements for Q2 2023, TSMC reported a revenue of $15.43 billion and a net income of $5.83 billion, with a net income ratio of 0.012. Despite strong AI processor demand, these figures reflect the broader macroeconomic impacts affecting most segments. In contrast, during previous cycles, TSMC managed more robust recoveries, likely due to stronger market conditions and demand.\n\nFor future performance, TSMC has not provided specific guidance on earnings but has indicated that the recovery will be gradual. The company is likely focusing on strategic initiatives to manage inventory and leverage AI demand to mitigate broader market weaknesses."

                        "growth assumption that is super helpful. But I'm wondering how TSMC can judge the AI demand? Because right now, it's [indiscernible] right now, customers are very aggressive booking capacity. So I'm wondering how company can judge whether those AI SME demand is for real? And also in terms of breakdown, I'm wondering whether companies said ASIC, the customer ship is outgrowing GPU. I think the more important one should be the first part of the question, especially investors are concerned whether AI is cannibalizing the CPU server demand. So - so those are kind of the questions are in our mind. Thank you.\\nJeff Su: Okay. Let me summarize your second question, Charlie. Charges on AI demand. He wants to know how do we judge the demand properly because customers are very aggressive, but how in his words, how do we know that this demand is real. And then also, how do we see the demand specifically for ASIC as it relates to AI?\\nWendell Huang: Okay. You want to answer?\\nC. C. Wei: Let me try"
