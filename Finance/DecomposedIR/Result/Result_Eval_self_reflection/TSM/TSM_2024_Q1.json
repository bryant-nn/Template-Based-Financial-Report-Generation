Here is an improved analysis based on the feedback:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details:**\n   - The company's first quarter revenue was reported as TWD 18,546,201,336 (approximately USD 18.5 billion), with a sequential decrease of 3.8% in USD due to smartphone seasonality. Gross profit for the quarter was TWD 9,842,119,470, reflecting a gross margin of 53.1%, which increased by 0.1 percentage points from the previous quarter.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance:**\n   - The decrease in revenue was primarily due to smartphone seasonality, indicating a shift in demand within the product mix. Despite this, the demand for High-Performance Computing (HPC) products provided some offsetting effects. Advanced technologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 65% of wafer revenue, with 3-nanometer technology contributing 9%.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends and Changes:**\n   - The increase in gross margin, despite a less favorable foreign exchange rate, suggests that the product mix change positively impacted the wafer ASP. Specifically, the shift towards more advanced technologies like 3-nanometer may have contributed to a higher ASP, as these typically command higher prices. The less favorable exchange rate likely increased costs, but the improved product mix helped maintain profitability.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance:**\n   - Looking forward, the company expects stronger business performance in the second quarter and an increased contribution from 3-nanometer technologies, which may further influence ASP and margins. However, this shift is expected to dilute the gross margin by 3 to 4 percentage points in the second half of 2024 due to higher costs associated with advanced technology production.\n\nIn summary, while specific numerical changes in wafer ASP are not provided, the overall analysis indicates that the ASP has been positively influenced by a favorable product mix shift towards advanced technologies, despite adverse foreign exchange impacts.

This improvement was primarily driven by changes in the product mix due to smartphone seasonality, although it was partially offset by a less favorable foreign exchange rate.\n\n3. **Operating Margin**:\n   - The operating margin increased by 0.4 percentage points sequentially to 42%, benefiting from tighter expense controls, which helped operating expenses account for 11.1% of net revenue, lower than the 12% initially guided.\n\n4. **N3 Process Node Impact**:\n   - The N3 process node is expected to dilute gross margins by 3 to 4 percentage points in the second half of the year. This impact is considered more severe than previous nodes like N5 or N7, likely due to higher initial production costs and challenges in achieving optimal yield rates.\n\n5. **Revenue Contribution by Technology**:\n   - The 3-nanometer (N3) technology contributed 9% of wafer revenue in Q1 2024.\n   - The 5-nanometer (N5) and 7-nanometer (N7) technologies contributed 37% and 19% of wafer revenue, respectively.\n   - Overall, advanced technologies (7-nanometer and below) accounted for 65% of wafer revenue, underscoring their critical role in TSM's revenue mix.\n\n6. **Context for Financial Performance**:\n   - TSM's performance was influenced by smartphone seasonality and ongoing demand in high-performance computing (HPC). However, expectations for the automotive platform shifted from an increase to a decrease, impacting revenue projections.\n\n7. **Expectations for Future Performance**:\n   - Management anticipates continued challenges with the N3 node, but expects future nodes to potentially have less severe margin dilution. TSM is likely focusing on improving yield rates and reducing production costs for N3 to mitigate its impact.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the analysis provides a clearer picture of TSM's financial performance, the impact of different technology nodes on margins, and the company's strategic outlook in the semiconductor industry."

His question is saying we have a nice upside to our revenue in the first half of this year, but we have kept the full year guidance in to grow low to mid-20s. So is that because we are more cautious on the second half? Or is it because we will see how things go? But I'm not sure if you mean by upside to the first half, Mehdi. You're saying, of course, our first quarter, as C. C. said, was slightly ahead of our guidance in U.S. dollar term, but very minutely. But -- yes?\\nWendell Huang: Yes. Mehdi, our guidance for the quarterly profile did not change. We always said that quarter-over-quarter, there will be growth. And also, the full year guidance will stay the same.",
