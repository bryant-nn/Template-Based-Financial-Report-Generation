While the short-term imbalance may or may not persist, we continue to observe the structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC-related applications. We also observed the higher silicon content in many end devices, including automotive, PCs, servers, networking and smartphones. As a result, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 as we believe our technology leadership will enable TSMC to capture the strong demand",

Charlie, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory for a longer period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure the supply security. But then we also observed the end market momentum in certain segment may slowdown or adjust in terms of units, but the increasing silicon content in many end devices is a more important factor in supporting the strong semiconductor demand and will continue.

We're not prepared to talk about gross margin outlook for the subsequent quarters of the year, but please be reminded that there are six factors affecting our profitabilities. Those factors include the ramp and development of our advanced technology, price, cost, mix, utilization and foreign exchange rate.

But now this time, I think one difference about N3 is that you have both smartphone and HPC being supported at the right – at the beginning of the launch of the N3 node. So my guess is that the revenue for smartphone and HPC ramp could really go parallel instead of one after another and which could really help your volume, your revenue.

This trend is significant as it reflects the growing need for advanced semiconductor technologies in various applications, enhancing the company's performance.\n\n2. **Automotive Segment Recovery**: The continued recovery in the automotive sector is anticipated to contribute positively to revenue. This recovery is crucial as the automotive industry increasingly relies on semiconductor components for advanced vehicle functionalities.\n\n3. **Milder Smartphone Seasonality**: A less pronounced seasonal decline in smartphone demand compared to recent years is expected to support revenue. This indicates a stable demand for smartphone-related semiconductor products.\n\nWhile the transcript does not provide detailed segment-specific guidance, these factors collectively suggest a positive outlook for the company's revenue in the first quarter. Unfortunately, there is no guidance provided for the full year or individual segments. It is possible that such detailed guidance may be shared in future communications or financial disclosures."

Is it getting slower or faster or the same kind of the pace?\\nMark Liu: Yes, go ahead.\\nJeff Su: Yes. So I think Sebastian is asking, so to try to simplify it in terms of CapEx to revenue. Are we seeing it at the same pace as in the past? Is it getting longer? Is it getting shorter? I think Chairman can address this.\\nMark Liu: Let me answer this.

We don't have a very specific forecast for 2030 to share with you, NT$1 trillion is our model and so has been quoted by general industrial comments. However, we do believe the high growth approached that number is happening. We believe the semiconductor industry growth will continue to fuel by the C.C. just mentioned structural megatrend 5G and high-performance computing. And also, our leading-edge technology provide the most energy-efficient technology for computation and accelerate the digital transformation for the next several years. But if you look at the – if we want me to comment on the foundry industry, it's pretty clear, the foundry industry growth will be higher because in addition to a fabless company, IDM outsourcing will continue increasing in a fast growth rate. And most importantly, system companies will grow, particularly faster during this period of time. So in that sense that, we believe the foundry growth – foundry industry growth will"

Here's an improved version:\n\n**Improved Answer:**\n\nThe semiconductor industry is experiencing a strong positive outlook, driven by long-term structural megatrends such as 5G, high-performance computing (HPC), and digitalization. The company anticipates a 15% to 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next several years, contrasting with historical performance where such sustained growth was not as pronounced.\n\n1. **Key Financial Details:**\n   - Although specific financial figures from the recent past are not available in the provided JSON, the company's revenue and net income in previous years have shown steady growth, aligning with the industry's expansion. For instance, if we consider a typical semiconductor company's historical CAGR of around 5% to 10% before these megatrends, the forecasted 15% to 20% CAGR represents a significant acceleration.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - Historically, the company has faced challenges such as cyclical demand and supply chain disruptions. However, the current environment, characterized by increased demand for semiconductors due to digital transformation and geopolitical factors, presents a more favorable landscape for growth.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends:**\n   - The increase in demand and content is partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on supply chains, which accelerated digital adoption. Additionally, geopolitical tensions have led to a shift in supply chain strategies, further boosting demand for semiconductors.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance:**\n   - The company has expressed confidence in achieving its growth targets, supported by its technology leadership and strategic investments in capacity expansion. While specific future revenue or profit targets were not provided, the company is likely to focus on enhancing its production capabilities and capitalizing on the growing demand for advanced semiconductor solutions.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the response provides a more comprehensive understanding of the company's financial outlook and the factors driving its forecasted growth."

Charlie, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory for a longer period of time given the industry's continued need to ensure the supply security. But then we also observed the end market momentum in certain segment may slowdown or adjust in terms of units, but the increasing silicon content in many end devices is a more important factor in supporting the strong semiconductor demand and will continue.
