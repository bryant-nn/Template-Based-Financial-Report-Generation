However, several qualitative insights can be gathered:\n\n1. **Overall Revenue Guidance**: The company has provided an overall revenue growth guidance of approximately 20% for the year 2021. This growth is driven by stronger customer engagement in advanced technology nodes, specifically N3 and N5 processes.\n\n2. **Segment Performance Drivers**:\n   - **N3 and N5 Processes**: These are highlighted as key drivers for the revenue growth, indicating strong demand and customer engagement in these advanced technology nodes.\n   - **Pricing Adjustments**: The guidance includes potential price increases, which may contribute to revenue growth across segments.\n\n3. **Impact on Segments**:\n   - While specific segment-wise sales figures are not detailed, the emphasis on N3 and N5 suggests that segments related to high-performance computing (HPC) and advanced technology nodes are likely to see significant contributions to revenue growth.\n\n4. **Factors Affecting Guidance**:\n   - The sequential decline in gross margin for the second quarter is attributed to a mix change, slower cost improvements due to high fab utilization, and the absence of a positive inventory revaluation.\n\nFor more detailed segment-wise guidance, it would typically be found in detailed financial reports or upcoming earnings calls where the company may provide further breakdowns and insights."

                        "does the depreciation growth look like this year and then beyond?\\nWendell Huang: Okay. I can share with you that the depreciation this year will be around 30% higher than last year. And we are not ready to share with you the rest of the 5-year period depreciation at this moment.\\nJeff Su: Okay. Do you have a second question, Mehdi?\\nMehdi Hosseinii: Okay. Sure. Yes, I have a second question. You raised your CapEx spending, given the increased demand by your customer. But your revenue growth target remains the same at 10% to 15%. Why aren't you raising the revenue target as you're raising the CapEx?\\nJeff Su: Okay. So I think Mehdi is asking that we raised the CapEx spending. And so why -- what is our view of the growth target, 10% to 15%? Why are we not raising that as well?\\nWendell Huang: Mehdi, actually, if you think about this 10% to 15% 5-year CAGR, it's a pretty big range. From what we currently forecast, the revenue target is still within that range, maybe higher to the --",

Why is it basically lower than the first quarter or is sequential declining if you use the midpoint?\\nWendell Huang: Okay. Rick, let me explain to you. The sequential decline is mainly due to mix as the contribution from N5 will increase, but it still carries a dilutive effect. And secondly, we see a slower rate of cost improvement as our fabs continue to run at a very high level of utilization, leaving last time to do cost-improvement activities. And lastly, a more technical thing is the absence of a positive inventory revaluation in the quarter.\\nJeff Su: Okay. Thank you, Rick.\\nOperator: Next one to ask questions is Aaron Jeng from Nomura Securities.\\nAaron Jeng: This question was not asked before, so I wish to ask before end of the call.

Can you explain where is the upside coming from, I mean, by applications will be great. And does that include some pricing adjustments for those revised in the guidance?\\nJeff Su: All right. I think Charlie's first question is relating to our 2021 revenue guidance from now of around 20% to say what has changed versus last time.

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends indicate a 30% increase in depreciation this year compared to the previous year, driven by heightened capital expenditures (CapEx) due to increased customer demand. Despite these increases, the company maintains its revenue growth target at a 10% to 15% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five years. This suggests confidence in sustaining historical growth levels, although specific historical figures for revenue, profit, or earnings are not available in the provided financial statement JSON, which limits detailed comparison.\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\n- Depreciation is expected to rise by 30% year-over-year.\n- Revenue growth is projected at a 10% to 15% CAGR over the next five years.\n\n**Contextual Background:**\n- The company is experiencing increased customer demand, which justifies the raised CapEx. This investment is likely aimed at expanding production capacity or enhancing technology to meet demand.\n\n**Reasoning for Trends:**\n- The increase in depreciation is likely linked to the higher CapEx, as new investments in property, plant, and equipment lead to higher depreciation expenses.\n- Maintaining the revenue growth target despite increased spending indicates confidence in market demand and the company's competitive positioning.\n\n**Future Expectations:**\n- While the revenue growth target remains, other aspects like potential profit margins, cash flow expectations, and potential risks (such as market competition or economic downturns) are not detailed in the transcript or financial statement.\n- The company might face challenges like managing cost improvements and inventory revaluation, as indicated in the transcript.\n\nWithout specific historical data from the financial statement, a detailed comparison to past performance is limited. However, the strategic focus on CapEx and maintaining revenue targets suggests a commitment to growth and market leadership."

But just compared to last guidance, what was driving the upside?\\nWendell Huang: Okay. Actually, all the platforms have upside compared to 3 months ago.\\nCharlie Chan: Okay. Got you. And then my next question is about your capital intensity in the long term. I mean I think 1 or 2 quarters ago, company updated capital intensity, and at some point, can flow back to like 35% capital intensity. I'm not sure if that's the case for the coming 3 years.

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the answer based on the feedback, here are the improvements with specific quantitative details and contextual information:\n\nThe key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations for the company are as follows:\n\n### Key Drivers:\n\n1. **Growth in HPC and Automotive Platforms**: These platforms are projected to grow at a rate higher than the corporate average. This suggests robust demand and potential for increased sales, driven by advancements in technology and increased adoption in these sectors.\n\n2. **Smartphone and IoT Platforms**: The expected growth in these areas is close to the corporate average, indicating steady demand. This reflects the ongoing integration of IoT in various applications and sustained demand for smartphones.\n\n3. **Customer Engagement on Advanced Technologies**: Stronger customer engagement on N3 and N5 technologies indicates future sales growth. As these advanced technologies are increasingly adopted, they are likely to drive significant demand.\n\n### Key Risks:\n\n1. **Structural Cost Increases**: The company has mentioned structural cost increases, such as those related to chemicals or equipment prices. These could affect profitability and sales if not managed effectively, potentially squeezing margins.\n\n2. **Capital Intensity**: The company's capital intensity, which may flow back to around 35%, could impact long-term gross margin trends. If capital expenditures do not lead to proportional revenue growth, this could pose a financial risk.\n\n3. **Mix and Cost Improvement Challenges**: A sequential decline in gross margin due to product mix and slower cost improvement could impact sales expectations. This is particularly relevant as the contribution from N5 increases, which currently has a dilutive effect on margins.\n\n### Financial Context and Performance:\n\n- **Recent Financial Performance**: While specific revenue and profit figures are not provided in the JSON data, the company has updated its 2021 revenue guidance to around 20% growth. This change is attributed to stronger-than-expected performance across all platforms.\n\n- **Historical Sales Trends**: The company has experienced growth in its high-performance computing and automotive sectors, which are expected to continue driving sales.\n\n- **Future Guidance**: The company anticipates continued growth driven by technological advancements and increased customer engagement in advanced technologies. However, it acknowledges the potential impact of cost increases and capital intensity on future performance.\n\nBy integrating these quantitative and contextual elements, the answer provides a comprehensive overview of the company's future sales expectations, balancing growth opportunities with potential risks."
