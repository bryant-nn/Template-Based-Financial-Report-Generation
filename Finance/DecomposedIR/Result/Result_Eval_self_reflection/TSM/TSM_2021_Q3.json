And I know you don't really want to give the next year's guidance, but based on that 5%, 20% price hike in terms of a percentage of a gross margin improvement, can your  comment on the margin improvement? Thank you.\\nJeff Su: Okay. Charlie's second question is asking about pricing. And he is asking that recently there's lots of news that we have increased our price by anywhere from 5% to 20%, so he wants to know how do we decide how",

In the near term, we continue to observe short-term imbalances due to interruptions in the supply chain brought over"

                    "init_answer": "The transcript does not provide specific sales guidance for each segment in the upcoming quarter or full year. However, TSMC's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to be between $15.4 billion and $15.7 billion, supported by strong demand across its four core platforms: smartphone, HPC (High-Performance Computing), IoT (Internet of Things), and automotive-related applications. The company anticipates its full-year 2021 revenue to grow about 24% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms, primarily driven by its industry-leading 5-nanometer technology.\n\nWhile segment-specific financial projections are not available, the transcript highlights strong demand across these platforms, suggesting robust market conditions. The smartphone segment likely benefits from ongoing technological advancements and consumer upgrades. The HPC segment is driven by increased demand for high-performance computing solutions, possibly due to cloud computing and AI developments. IoT growth is likely supported by the proliferation of connected devices, while the automotive segment benefits from the increasing integration of advanced electronics in vehicles.\n\nFor future performance, TSMC continues to focus on maintaining its leadership in advanced technology nodes, which should support sustained growth across all segments. Additionally, the company is likely to invest in expanding its production capabilities to meet the growing demand and ensure supply chain resilience."

Go ahead, please\\nSebastian Hou: Thank you for taking my questions. I only have one. It's on pricing. I think last quarter the Company talk about firming up pricing to reflect the cost. And based on the higher long-term gross margin guidance that the CFO gave this time of 50% plus, I'm curious if this round of pricing adjustment is enough to absorb the higher CapEx intensity only for this year or the next multiple years. I have a follow-up to this question, so I will stop here.\\nJeff Su: Sebastian, his first question is on pricing and we have talked about firming our pricing, actually also talking about selling our value in the past. So he is wondering now that we say 50% in higher gross margin, does that mean we -- if it's enough to cover"

This growth is primarily driven by stronger performance in advanced technology sectors, although there is a noted decline in market share for legacy technologies. The company is adapting its capital expenditures to focus more on mature technology, reflecting customer demand.\n\nHistorically, the company's back-end business has demonstrated seasonal profitability, with the third quarter typically being the most profitable due to higher demand. This pattern is expected to continue, contributing to the improved profitability in Q3.\n\nWhile the financial statements provided do not contain specific historical figures for revenue, profit, or earnings, the company aims to maintain a gross margin of 50% or higher. This target suggests a proactive pricing strategy to sustain long-term profitability despite increased capital expenditure intensity.\n\nFor future performance, the company is expected to continue leveraging its advanced technology offerings while addressing the softness in the smartphone and PC markets, which is attributed to both end-demand issues and component shortages. The strategic focus on mature technology and pricing adjustments is anticipated to support the company's growth and profitability goals in the coming years."

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the financial report answer based on the provided feedback, I'll incorporate specific financial metrics, historical context, detailed explanations for trends, and expectations for future performance:\n\n---\n\nThe key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations for the company include:\n\n1. **Component Shortages**: The semiconductor industry is experiencing component shortages, which impact supply chains. This could lead to sales disruptions if the shortages persist, affecting the company's ability to meet demand.\n\n2. **End Demand Softness**: There is noted softness in the smartphone and PC markets. This decline in consumer demand could lead to reduced sales unless these markets rebound. The softness is attributed to both economic factors and the ongoing component shortages.\n\n3. **Price Increases**: The company has implemented a price hike ranging from 5% to 20%. This strategic move aims to improve gross margins and offset potential volume declines. However, it carries the risk of negatively affecting demand if customers are sensitive to price changes.\n\n4. **Seasonal Variability**: The back-end business is seasonal, with high and low seasons throughout the year. This variability could influence quarterly sales and profitability, impacting financial performance.\n\n5. **Technological Transitions**: The company's ability to transition and migrate technologies, such as moving to advanced nodes, could drive future sales by meeting the demand for more advanced semiconductor products. This is crucial as devices increasingly require higher silicon content.\n\n6. **Reduction in Wafer Supply Shortage**: An improvement in wafer supply, particularly for automotive customers, is expected, which could positively impact sales in this sector from the third quarter onwards.\n\n**Financial Metrics and Historical Context**:\n- Unfortunately, the financial statement JSON provided does not include specific financial metrics like revenue or net income for Q3 2021, which limits the ability to provide precise figures. However, understanding these numbers is crucial for assessing the company's current financial standing and performance trajectory.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance**:\n- While the company has not provided explicit guidance for future performance, the strategic price increases and anticipated improvements in wafer supply suggest potential for revenue growth. However, this is contingent on market recovery in the smartphone and PC sectors and successful technology transitions.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTo fully assess the company's future prospects, stakeholders would benefit from specific guidance or forecasts, such as projected revenue growth percentages or profit margins. This would provide a clearer outlook on what the company expects in the coming quarters or years."
