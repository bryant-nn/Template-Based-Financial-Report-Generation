In 2023, the company's revenue growth was primarily driven by High-Performance Computing (HPC), which exhibited a much higher growth rate than the corporate average. This was complemented by increased demand for AI applications, notably following the rise in popularity of ChatGPT. Customers have responded by requesting TSMC to enhance its capacity, both in front-end and back-end operations, which bolsters the company's confidence in future revenue increases.\n\nFor the upcoming quarter, TSMC expects revenue to range between US$18 billion and US$18.8 billion, indicating a 6.2% sequential decline at the midpoint. This forecast reflects the seasonal downturn in smartphone sales, although it is expected to be partially offset by sustained demand in HPC.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, TSMC's past revenue for Q4 2023 was approximately US$20.38 billion, with a net income of about US$8.21 billion. The company's gross margin was between 52% and 54%, with an operating margin projected between 40% and 42%. These figures provide a solid baseline for assessing future performance.\n\nIn terms of broader industry context, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a shift towards AI-driven applications, which is likely to continue influencing TSMC's growth trajectory. The company is strategically investing in its technology and capacity to meet this demand, positioning itself to capitalize on these emerging opportunities.\n\nLooking ahead, while the immediate focus is on managing seasonal fluctuations and maintaining HPC momentum, TSMC is also preparing for long-term growth by enhancing its capabilities in AI and other growth platforms. The company has not provided specific long-term financial targets, but its strategic initiatives indicate a commitment to sustaining growth and adapting to industry trends."
