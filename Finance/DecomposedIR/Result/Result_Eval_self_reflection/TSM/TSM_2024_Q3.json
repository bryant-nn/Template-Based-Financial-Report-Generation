However, based on the provided context, several factors could influence wafer ASP:\n\n1. **Demand for AI and HPC**: There is robust demand for AI and HPC (High-Performance Computing) applications, which typically require advanced processing capabilities. This demand could drive up ASP as customers are willing to pay more for cutting-edge technology.\n\n2. **Advanced Technology Nodes**: The introduction of advanced nodes like 2-nanometer is likely to command higher ASP due to their increased performance and efficiency. Advanced nodes generally have higher production costs, which are passed on to customers.\n\n3. **Chiplet Adoption**: The adoption of chiplets could affect wafer area requirements, potentially optimizing manufacturing efficiency and reducing costs. However, the demand for advanced nodes remains strong, which may offset any potential reduction in ASP due to increased efficiency.\n\n**Financial Performance Context**:\nFrom the financial statement, TSMC reported a Q3 2024 revenue of approximately $23.89 billion, with a gross profit of $13.82 billion, indicating a strong financial position. The company's net income was $10.23 billion, reflecting a healthy net income ratio of 13%. These figures suggest that despite any variations in ASP, TSMC maintains robust profitability and operational efficiency.\n\n**Future Expectations**:\nWhile specific future ASP guidance is not provided, the company's engagement with advanced technology nodes and the ongoing demand for AI and HPC solutions suggest a positive outlook. TSMC is likely to continue focusing on innovation and capacity expansion to meet market demands, which could support stable or increasing ASPs in the future.\n\nIn summary, while exact ASP figures are not available, the combination of high demand for advanced technologies and TSMC's strong financial performance indicates a favorable environment for maintaining or potentially increasing wafer ASP."

Can you give us kind of an idea of what will be the growth outlook for a different kind of segmentation in that new definition?\\nJeff Su: OK, so Laura, your second question is on Foundry 2.0.

The first one I had was, I'm kind of curious on the non-AI demand. How do you look at your wafer demand for PC and mobile into calendar ‘25, and have you seen any meaningful revision upwards or downwards on that? And then I had a follow-up.\\nJeff Su: Okay, so Krish's first question is really focused on PC and mobile demand. How do we see this demand going into 2025? Have we seen it improve or revision up or downwards, and how would we look at it going into next year?\\nC. C. Wei: Okay, Krish. The unique growth of PC and smartphone is still in a low single digit, but the more important is the content. The content now we put more AI into their chip,",

C. Wei: I hope so. But as I said, today we don't have a long-term CAGR number to share with you. Okay.\\nBruce Lu: Okay. Let me switch gears to 2-nanometers and A16. So I think that, you know, the HPC demand and -- for the node is very strong. We do see more customer engagement for 2-nanometers, but at the same time, we also see more chip load design in 2-nanometers, which might effectively lower the 2-nanometer wafer area requirement. So how should we think about your 2- nanometer capacity bill versus the 3, 5, and 7 in the past? And how do we see the A16 migration beyond 2-nanometers?\\nJeff Su: Okay.

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the comprehensiveness and clarity of the answer regarding trends in wafer demand across different customer segments, let's incorporate the suggested improvements:\n\n**Trends and Financial Impact:**\n1. **Revenue and Profit Context**: For Q3 2024, TSMC reported revenue of approximately $23.89 billion and a net income of about $10.23 billion. While the transcript does not provide specific revenue figures for individual segments like PC, mobile, or HPC, these segments contribute significantly to the overall revenue, with the increasing AI content in chips likely boosting demand and revenue in these areas.\n\n2. **Market Position and Segment Significance**: The PC and mobile segments, although experiencing low single-digit growth, remain substantial contributors to TSMC's revenue. The HPC segment, driven by strong demand for advanced nodes like 2-nanometers, suggests a strategic focus on high-growth, high-margin areas, potentially increasing its share of the revenue mix.\n\n**Reasoning for Trends:**\n3. **AI Influence**: The rise in AI content within chips is a key driver of demand, as AI capabilities become integral to modern computing devices. This trend reflects broader industry shifts towards more intelligent and capable devices, which require advanced semiconductor technologies.\n\n4. **Modest Growth in Traditional Segments**: The modest growth in PC and mobile segments can be attributed to market saturation and longer device replacement cycles. However, the integration of AI features is expected to gradually rejuvenate demand in these segments.\n\n**Future Expectations and Guidance:**\n5. **Growth Outlook**: While specific future projections are not provided in the transcript, TSMC's focus on advanced nodes and AI-driven demand suggests a positive long-term outlook, particularly in the HPC segment. The company's strategic investments in cutting-edge technologies are likely to sustain growth and enhance its competitive position.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, we provide a more detailed and informative response that situates wafer demand trends within TSMC's broader financial performance and strategic direction."

Due to operating leverage, total operating expenses accounted for 10.4% of net revenue. Thus, operating margin increased by 5 percentage points sequentially to 47.5%. Overall, our third quarter EPS was 12.54 NT and ROE was 33.4%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of",

I think TSMC has been guiding for 15% to 20% revenue CAGR from ‘21 to ‘26. On the back of the insane AI demand, do we have an updated outlook for the revenue guidance beyond 2026? In addition, when TSMC guided in 2021, TSMC achieved 25% growth almost every year except for 2023. So what kind of revenue growth outlook or the growth pattern in the next five years? Do we expect to be a more stable growth every year or do we expect to be a stronger growth for most of the year and the one-year weakness?\\nJeff Su: Okay. So thank you, Bruce. So Bruce's first question is about our long-term growth outlook. He notes, yes, we did provide a long-term revenue growth CAGR of between 15% to 20% CAGR in U.S. dollar terms from ‘21 to ‘26. So he wants to know what is the updated revenue guidance, the outlook beyond 2026. And he also notes that when we provided this, you know,"

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for TSMC indicate a stable approach to capital expenditures (CapEx) and a strong revenue growth outlook, which contrasts with historical patterns of CapEx increasing significantly during strong demand cycles. Historically, TSMC's CapEx would rise considerably during periods of high demand, but for 2023 and 2024, CapEx is expected to remain stable in the $30 billion to $31 billion range, despite robust growth projections.\n\nIn terms of revenue, TSMC has historically achieved almost 25% annual growth, except in 2023. The company's revenue for Q3 2024 was approximately $23.89 billion, with a net income of $10.23 billion, reflecting a strong financial position. TSMC has guided for a 15% to 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue from 2021 to 2026, driven by strong demand, particularly in AI. This suggests a more stable and sustained growth pattern compared to the historical variability, with expectations of continued strong demand beyond 2026, particularly due to AI advancements.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the stable CapEx despite high demand: strategic investments in technology and capacity have already been made, and the company may be optimizing existing resources to meet demand without significantly increasing CapEx. Additionally, TSMC might be managing its financial risk by maintaining stable CapEx levels.\n\nPotential risks to these projections include geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and technological advancements by competitors, which could impact TSMC's market position and financial performance.\n\nIn summary, while TSMC's CapEx is expected to remain stable, the revenue growth is anticipated to continue at a robust pace, reflecting a shift towards more sustained and stable growth compared to past cycles. The company is strategically positioned to capitalize on the growing AI demand while managing financial risks."
