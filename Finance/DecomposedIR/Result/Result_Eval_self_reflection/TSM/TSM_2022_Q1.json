Advanced technologies, particularly 5-nanometer (20% of wafer revenue) and 7-nanometer (30%), significantly contributed, with advanced technologies making up 50% of wafer revenue. Despite not having exact revenue figures, estimates suggest around USD 17.57 billion. This aligns with guidance, projecting a high 20s percentage growth for the year, driven by volume, price, and product mix.

                    "init_answer": "Based on the earnings call transcript and financial data, the following trends and financial insights can be observed in wafer demand across different customer segments:\n\n1. **High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Automotive Demand**: There is a notable increase in demand from HPC and automotive-related applications, which is expected to support business growth into the second quarter of 2022. This demand is partially offset by seasonal variations in smartphone demand.\n\n2. **5G and HPC Applications**: The transcript highlights a structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand driven by 5G and HPC-related applications. This multiyear trend is expected to drive significant semiconductor device unit volume growth, indicating robust future demand.\n\n3. **Inventory Levels**: Due to COVID-related supply chain disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties, the supply chain is maintaining higher inventory levels than historical norms. This suggests that customers are stockpiling to ensure supply security, which may impact financial metrics such as inventory turnover ratios.\n\n4. **N3 and N3E Technology Engagement**: There is strong customer engagement with N3 and N3E technologies. N3 is expected to ramp up, driven by HPC and smartphone applications, while N3E is anticipated to enhance performance, power, and yield. This indicates potential for future revenue growth from these advanced technologies.\n\n### Financial Context and Performance:\n\n- **Revenue and Profit**: Although specific financial figures such as revenue or profit related to wafer demand are not provided in the JSON, the trends suggest potential positive impact on revenue and profitability, especially with the increased demand in HPC and automotive sectors.\n\n- **Overall Financial Health**: The absence of specific financial data in the JSON limits the ability to directly assess the company's current financial performance. However, the strong demand trends and customer engagement in advanced technologies suggest a positive outlook for financial health.\n\n- **Future Performance Expectations**: The company anticipates continued strong demand in HPC and automotive sectors, with significant interest in N3 and N3E technologies. This suggests potential for revenue growth and improved financial performance in the upcoming quarters.\n\nIn summary, while specific financial figures are not available, the trends indicate robust demand across key segments, which is likely to positively influence the company's financial performance. Future guidance suggests continued growth driven by technological advancements and market demand in high-performance computing and automotive applications."

This growth is supported by strong demand in the High-Performance Computing (HPC) and automotive segments, as highlighted in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n1. **Key Financial Details or Numbers**: While the transcript lacks specific revenue, profit, or earnings figures for each segment, it does note a sequential revenue increase of 12.1% in NT terms (11.6% in U.S. dollar terms) for the first quarter of 2022.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**: The strong demand in the HPC and automotive segments indicates a positive trend for TSMC in these areas, likely driven by increased adoption of technology and innovation in these markets. However, no specific comparison to previous years or industry benchmarks is provided.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes**: The demand in the HPC and automotive segments could be attributed to ongoing technological advancements and increased reliance on semiconductor technologies in these industries. Broader market trends such as the growth of AI, cloud computing, and electric vehicles may also be contributing factors.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidances for Future Performance**: Although specific segment guidance is not available, TSMC's confidence in exceeding the high end of their revenue guidance suggests a positive outlook. Strategic initiatives or market conditions such as continued innovation in semiconductor design and manufacturing efficiency could influence future performance.\n\nIn summary, while the transcript provides a general outlook for TSMC's revenue growth, it lacks detailed segment-specific guidance or financial figures. The company's performance is buoyed by strong demand in key segments, with broader market trends likely supporting this growth."

So we know that each customer’s demand and their forecast and we plan our capacity, we plan our technology by working with them. So if there is a downturn, sure, we’ve got the firsthand information from our customers. And we collect them together, and we do get it. And we decide our long-term CapEx and capacity.

So let me summarize Randy’s first question is about our full year outlook, which as C.C. mentioned in his key messages that we expect to be at -- likely to be at or exceed the high end of our guidance of mid- to high 20s. So Randy’s question is, what is driving the higher or better full year outlook given the macro environment looks a bit more shaky. Is it technology? Is it market share, et cetera? And what is the outlook by platform?\\nC. C. Wei: Randy, we expect our HPC platform to be TSMC’s strongest growing platform this year and the following years.
