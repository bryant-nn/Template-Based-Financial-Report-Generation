Year-over-year, revenue declined, aligning with TSMC's guidance of a 10% decrease in the first half of 2023 compared to the same period last year. The decline was attributed to weakening macroeconomic conditions, softening end-market demand, and customer inventory adjustments. Despite these challenges, TSMC's revenue was within the lower end of its guidance range. For the second quarter, TSMC expects revenue between USD 15.2 billion and USD 16 billion, indicating a 6.7% sequential decline at the midpoint. Looking forward, TSMC anticipates a 25% revenue increase in the second half of 2023 compared to the first half, driven by new product launches, and expects full-year revenue to decline by a low to mid-single-digit percentage in U.S. dollar terms, aiming to outperform the broader semiconductor market.",

This decline was attributed to weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end-market demand. The decreased revenue indicates a challenging environment for maintaining or increasing ASP.\n\n2. **Gross Margin and Operating Expenses:**\n   - Gross margin decreased by 5.9 percentage points to 56.3%, mainly due to lower capacity utilization and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. This decrease suggests that while ASP might have been pressured by these factors, the company implemented stringent cost controls to mitigate the impact.\n\n3. **Demand and Capacity Utilization:**\n   - The company reported high demand for advanced technology nodes like the 3-nanometer process, which is fully utilized. This strong demand amidst limited supply could support higher ASPs for these advanced products.\n\n4. **Future Expectations and Guidance:**\n   - Utilization rates are expected to improve in the second half of the year, suggesting potential stabilization or increase in ASP as capacity utilization enhances production efficiency. The company anticipates a stronger second half, driven by new product launches and increased demand across platforms.\n\n5. **Strategic Positioning:**\n   - The focus on advanced technologies and high demand for the 3-nanometer process indicates a strategic shift that could positively influence ASP by capitalizing on leading-edge technology offerings.\n\nIn summary, while specific ASP figures are not provided, the company's financial performance and strategic emphasis on advanced technology nodes suggest that ASP may be supported by strong demand and improved utilization rates in the future. The decrease in gross margin points to challenges such as lower utilization and currency impacts, but cost control measures and expected demand recovery could stabilize or enhance ASP moving forward."

However, we can derive the following insights:\n\n1. **Revenue and Earnings**:\n   - The company's Q1 2023 revenue decreased by 16.1% in U.S. dollars due to weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end-market demand.\n   - The net income for Q1 2023 was approximately USD 6.77 billion, with an EPS of TWD 7.98.\n\n2. **Margins**:\n   - **Gross Margin**: The gross margin for Q1 2023 was 56.3%, reflecting a decrease of 590 basis points from the previous quarter, primarily due to lower capacity utilization and a less favorable foreign exchange rate. The second quarter guidance projects a gross margin midpoint of 53%, influenced by continued lower capacity utilization and higher costs.\n   - **Operating Margin**: The operating margin for Q1 2023 was 45.5%, down 6.5 percentage points from the previous quarter. The guidance for Q2 indicates an operating margin range between 39.5% and 41.5%.\n\n3. **Context and Reasoning**:\n   - The decline in margins was largely due to external economic pressures, including a challenging macroeconomic environment and adjustments in customer demand. Additionally, lower capacity utilization and unfavorable exchange rates impacted profitability. However, stringent cost control measures helped mitigate some of these effects.\n\n4. **Future Expectations**:\n   - For Q2 2023, the company anticipates revenue between USD 15.2 billion and USD 16 billion, representing a sequential decline. Despite these challenges, the company aims to achieve a long-term gross margin of 53% or higher through cost management and leveraging government support.\n   - Market conditions and strategic initiatives, such as advanced process technology adoption, will play a crucial role in shaping future performance.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the answer provides a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of the company's financial performance, addressing key financial details, context, reasoning, and future expectations."

The company also expects a gross margin between 52% and 54% and an operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5% for the second quarter. These expectations are influenced by factors such as macroeconomic conditions and the company's cost control efforts.\n\nFor future performance, the transcript hints at a potential 25% revenue increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half, driven by new product ramps and launches. However, specific segment guidance is not provided. For detailed segment information, further company disclosures or segment reporting would be necessary, typically found in more detailed financial statements or future earnings releases."

I have one for Wendell. This question comes from every earnings conference call, capital intensity. Should we assume that as you tighten your CapEx project for this year? And especially in the context of declining revenues for the whole year, are we at the tail end of elevated capital intensity?  Or should we assume that you -- over the past couple of years, there has been significant investment and starting next year, you're going to be able to scale your revenues? Is that the right way of thinking about all these investments that you have done?\\nJeff Su: Okay. So Mehdi's second question is on -- around capital intensity. He wants to know, given the guidance we have provided for 2023, are we at the tail end of the higher capital intensity period or elevated capital intensity period? And then will we start to, I guess, harvest or",
                        "you're expecting over the medium term.\\nJeff Su: Okay. So Brett has a quick follow-up with regards to Japan. His question in terms of the government support or incentives we may receive. How will we account for it? How much will it be in 2023 and how significant? Is it most of it in the second half?\\nWendell Huang: Okay. Brett, let me reply this matter. In Japan, we will -- our total CapEx is about $8 billion, and we expect about 50% to receive from the government. And we will be production -- stop production at the end of next year. So the incentives from the government will be according -- will be based on the progress that we are building our fabs. So that gives you some idea of how much we can receive this year and next year.  How do we account for it? Basically, we will be -- that will be accounted for as an offset of depreciation. Okay?\\nJeff Su: Okay. Thank you, Brett. Operator, can we move on to the next participant then?\\nOperator: Next, we have Sunny Lin from UBS.\\nSunny",

First of all, we don't comment on specific suppliers or customers or competitors. Regarding this year's CapEx when we gave out the CapEx range, $32 billion to $36 billion, we have already started or tightened up our 2023 capital budget.  At this moment, we believe this range is appropriate and it's prudent under today's economic environment, that range is still valid. Now for next year, it's too early to talk about next year. But as I just stated, if the CapEx spend this year will be for future years, and CapEx spend next year will be for even future years. So if we see the growth opportunities is there, then we will continue to invest. That's the main policy, the principle that we have.\\nCharlie Chan: Yes. Yes, thanks for the clarification. So I guess the question is if, right, whether those growth drivers still there,"

For 2023, the company has projected a CapEx range of $32 billion to $36 billion, indicating ongoing substantial investment. In Q1 2023 alone, the capital expenditure was approximately $9.89 billion, reflecting the company's commitment to growth despite an anticipated decline in revenue for the year.\n\nHistorically, the company's strategy has focused on investing in growth opportunities, as demonstrated by the substantial capital expenditure. In Q1 2023, the company reported a net income of approximately $6.77 billion and free cash flow of about $2.71 billion, showcasing its ability to generate significant cash flow while investing heavily in its future. The decline in revenue is not detailed in the transcript or financial statement, but it suggests a strategic focus on long-term growth over short-term revenue gains.\n\nThe company's investments are expected to support future growth and revenue scaling, with the potential for reduced capital intensity in subsequent years as the benefits of these investments materialize. This aligns with the company's historical performance, where strategic investments have been made to capitalize on growth opportunities. Looking forward, the company anticipates leveraging these investments to enhance its competitive positioning and drive revenue growth, although specific revenue or profit targets for future periods are not provided in the available context."

The first one to ask a question, Gokul Hariharan from JPMorgan.\\nGokul Hariharan: First of all, can I talk -- can I ask a bit about the near-term demand dynamics? Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing by segments? Is the inventory correction trend largely similar across HPC, smartphone, IoT and auto? Or are you seeing any different dynamics in these segments, especially auto, you saw some shortage still in the last quarter.  And maybe also talk a little bit about 7-nanometer. Previously, we had an expectation, 7-nanometer will start recovering in second half of this year. Do we think 7-nanometer will still be recovering in second",

Your guide for June and also 2023 revenue suggests revenues in the second half of the year would be up by 25% versus the first half. And what I want to better understand is how will new product ramps drive this growth.  Is there anything quantitative or qualitative that you can offer us to understand the mechanics or the drivers behind this 25% growth in revenue from first half into the second half? And I have a follow-up.\\nJeff Su: Okay. Thank you, Mehdi. So Mehdi's first question is in looking at our guidance, his calculation implies around mid-20s half-on-half growth in the second half.

That will be the framework that we can provide to you.\\nJeff Su: Okay, Randy. You have a quick second question.\\nRandy Abrams: Yes, I'll do the quick second. So for 2-nanometer, if you could clarify the ramp, do you expect this steep ramp to be in 2025? Or is it more 2026? And do you also view that ramp being much more with the SOIC, the back-end integration throughput?\\nJeff Su: Okay. So Randy, second question is on 2-nanometer. We have said volume production in 2025. Will the large volume be in '25 or '26 as part of this question. And does this mean you will go hand-in-hand, I guess, with SoIC and advanced packaging?\\nC. C. Wei: Randy, let me answer the question. 2-nanometer technology definitely will start to ramp in 2025. And you asked about the volume. The volume in 2023 certainly is much higher than 2025 because 2025 is the year. But saying that, I mean that we are having HPC"
