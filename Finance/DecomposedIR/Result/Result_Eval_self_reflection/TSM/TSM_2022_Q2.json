The revenue increased by 8.8% sequentially in Taiwanese dollars (NT) and 3.4% in U.S. dollars. Although specific revenue figures were not provided, this growth was supported by favorable foreign exchange rates, cost improvements, and strategic value selling.\n\nHistorically, these sectors have shown robust growth, with HPC and IoT consistently contributing to the company's revenue stream. Compared to competitors, TSMC has maintained a competitive edge due to its leadership in advanced technology processes, such as 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies, which accounted for 51% of wafer revenue in the second quarter.\n\nThe expectation for the year's revenue to be closer to the lower end of the previously guided range of TWD 40 billion to TWD 44 billion suggests cautious optimism. Factors influencing this expectation include potential market volatility, ongoing supply chain challenges, and strategic decisions to focus on high-value sectors. This guidance reflects an understanding of both external market conditions and internal strategic priorities.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive financial analysis, specific revenue figures in both NT and USD, as well as a breakdown of contributions from each sector, would offer clearer insights.

And then the second question, a follow-up is, if I look at your CapEx run rate, the first half is running at about TWD 17 billion, which is below the lower end of your full year guidance. So I'm kind of curious, what are the tool delays that's causing the pushout of CapEx into next year? Is it like EUV? Is it like depth edge tools? Any color on that would be super helpful. Thank you very much.\\nJeff Su: Okay. So Krish has two questions. First is looking at our full year guidance to grow mid-30s, and he says this implies a decline in the fourth quarter?\\nC. C. Wei: No, I don't think so. We did the calculation. Maybe you can do that again. It's at least up.\\nWendell Huang: Yes. Krish, I would note that when we talk about mid-30s guidance, as C.C. said, that is in U.S. dollar terms. Okay.\\nJeff Su: And then his second question",

Okay.\\nJeff Su: And then his second question is on CapEx and sort of looking at the CapEx. His question is we have already said it will be closer to the lower end of the range. He wants to know what is driving the CapEx. Is it tool delays? Is it EUV? What types of equipment?\\nWendell Huang: No. I don't think we can go into that kind of details. But some of them got pushed out to next year, as C.C. mentioned. And every year, the CapEx profile can be difference quarter-by-quarter.\\nJeff Su: Okay, thank you. Operator, in the interest of time, I think weâll take questions from the last two participants, please. So, letâs move on to the next. \\nOperator: The next one to ask questions, Frank Lee from HSBC.\\nFrank Lee: Thank you. I wanted to just ask a question on, I guess, the overall profitability and also pricing. It seems like this",
                        "we would see a weaker first half next year.\\nC. C. Wei: No, we did not see that. We are actually -- we are working with our customers and we try our best to support our customers. As I said, even right now, our capacity remains very tight. So the switching between the next year's first quarter and this year's second half, no, we did not see that, just simply put it.\\nJeff Su: Great. Thank you, Frank. Operator, can we take questions from the last participant, please. \\nOperator: The last one to ask questions, Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank.\\nRobert Sanders: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have two. The first one is just if you could just discuss how much of next year's revenue is under LTA. The reason I'm asking is because there are some people in the market thinking that customers may be fearful of pushing our wafers because they may be jeopardizing agreements for next year. And then the second question would be just to on the chiplet question. I was just wondering what"

On the demand side, while we observe softness in consumer end market segment, the end market segments such as data center and automotive-related remains steady. And we are able to reallocate our capacity to support these areas. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, our customers' demand continues to exceed our ability to supply. We expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 and our full year growth to be mid-30% in U.S. dollar terms. Three key factor in supporting TSMC's strong structural demand are our technology leadership and differentiation, our strong portfolio in high-performance computing and our strategic relationship with customers. All of these factors are TSMC's strength in the foundry industry. First, on technology leadership and differentiation, TSMC's technology position is much stronger today as compared to previous years. Looking ahead to 2023, we are working diligently to provide the industry most advanced technologies and making it",

Congrats on the great result. I think I may say that the next few years, the revenue growth will still at the 15% to 20% growth, and it is driven by the compound -- dollar content growth.
