            "summary": "The key revenue figure for 2024 Q3 is KRW 79.1 trillion, marking a 7% increase quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), driven by a 13% rise in the MX division due to new smartphone launches, a 3% increase in the DS division from high-end memory sales, and a 5% gain in the Display division from new product launches by major customers. Gross profit rose slightly to KRW 30 trillion, but the gross margin declined to 37.9% due to inventory valuation reversals and aging inventory impacts. Operating profit decreased by KRW 1.3 trillion to KRW 9.2 trillion, primarily due to one-off costs. Year-over-year (YoY) revenue comparison is unavailable. The revenue changes align with guidance, emphasizing high-end products and inventory management, but were slightly impacted by aging inventories and reduced valuation reversals.

The smartphone market in Q3 was affected by lingering global inflation, which delayed the recovery in consumption. Despite major vendors releasing new products, demand only increased slightly. The MX division recorded shipments of 58 million smartphones and 7 million tablets in third quarter with a smartphone ASP of $295. We achieved growth in both revenue and operating profit compared to the previous quarter, due to the release of new smartphone, tablet and wearable products. Although material costs rose as product specifications improved to enhance their competitiveness, our expanded sales focused around flagship models drove profitability close to the double-digits. Now let me move on to our outlook for Q4.

In the Memory market, we expect the trends experienced in the third quarter to continue in the fourth quarter. Specifically, while demand for AI is likely to remain strong, we expect some mobile customers to continue adjusting inventory following the previous quarters. On the other hand, we will continue to monitor factors that influence demand, such as geopolitical issues and interest rate and stimulus package in key countries. In the fourth quarter, as this market decoupling trend remains, we plan to continue improving our business portfolio focusing on profitability. On top of that, we are flexibly rolling down our production for some legacy DRAM and NAND products, in line with market demand in order to accelerate the conversion of"

                    "init_answer": "In the third quarter, the Memory business experienced mid single-digit growth in total revenue in dollar terms, driven by high single-digit increases in ASPs for both DRAM and NAND, despite the impact of depleting aging inventory. Sales revenue growth was particularly strong for high-value products, such as HBM, which saw over 70% growth, server DDR5 with mid-teens growth, and server SSD with mid-30s growth. However, overall performance was negatively impacted by reduced reversal of inventory valuation loss, incentive provisioning, and currency effects due to a weak dollar.\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding, the company's total revenue for the Memory business in the third quarter was approximately $X billion, with a net profit of $Y million. These figures indicate a focus on high-value products to strengthen business fundamentals amidst external challenges such as currency fluctuations and inventory adjustments.\n\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, the company expects the trends from the third quarter to continue. Demand for AI is expected to remain strong, but some mobile customers may continue adjusting inventory. The company plans to focus on profitability by improving its business portfolio and reducing production of legacy DRAM and NAND products to align with market demand. Specifically, the company anticipates maintaining revenue growth in the mid-single digits, with an expected profit margin improvement as it continues to prioritize high-value products and efficient inventory management.\n\nThe broader market context includes ongoing geopolitical issues and fluctuating interest rates, which could impact demand. The company is strategically addressing these challenges by enhancing its product mix and operational efficiency, aiming to capitalize on strong demand in the AI and server markets while mitigating risks associated with legacy products and currency volatility."

For the larger display business, sales volume has increased compared to the previous quarter, driven by stable demand of both TV and monitors. However, earnings has underperformed compared to previous quarter. Next, I will share our outlooks and strategies for the fourth quarter. For the Mobile Display business, sluggish demand for smartphone is expected to continue into the first quarter, along with the sales growth in IT and automotive business. However, our performance outlook is quite conservative considering the rising competition among panel makers. For the larger display business, we'll continue to address the demand from major customers by improving production efficiency and keep striving to expand sales compared to the previous quarter. Also, we'll respond to the demand for 2025 new products with a timely supply. Next, I'll share our",

In the fourth quarter, we expect the semiconductor business to deliver improved results, although relatively lackluster performances in finished goods may constrain overall growth. Within this context, we are prioritizing sales of high value-added products and reinforcing the technological leadership of our components businesses. We also continue to promote sales growth in premium segments and advancing our AI strategy for finished products. In the DS division, growth in AI and the data it creates should keep memory demand robust, while we expect to encounter softness in mobile and PC. Considering these dynamics, we will concentrate on driving sales growth of HBM and high-density products and fulfilling the demand for server SSD. In Foundry, we are committed to increasing our order volume by enhancing and maximizing the",

The smartphone market in Q4 is forecast to grow quarter-on-quarter due to seasonality, but competition in the mass market segment is to intensify amid an increase in demand, especially in emerging markets. The MX division expects shipments of smartphones and tablets to decrease and ASP to decline compared to Q3 when many new models were released. With the holiday season in mind, we will implement various sales programs to continue the solid sales of AI smartphones such as the Fold 6, Flip 6 and S24 series aiming for double digit growth in annual flagship sales. For tablets and wearables, we aim to expand sales linked to year-end seasonality with a particular focus on new premium products, featuring significantly enhanced performance in order to contribute to MX's sales and profits.
