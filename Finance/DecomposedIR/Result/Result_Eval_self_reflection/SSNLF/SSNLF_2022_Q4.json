These factors led to a sequential decline in consolidated quarterly revenue by 8.2% to KRW 70.5 trillion. \n\n1. **Key Financial Details**:\n   - **Memory Business**: Revenue declined sharply due to a significant ASP (Average Selling Price) decline and inventory valuation losses as customers adjusted their inventories.\n   - **System LSI**: Earnings decreased as customer inventory adjustments led to reduced sales of key products.\n   - **Foundry**: This segment reported record quarterly revenue, driven by increased sales to major customers and expanded advanced node capacity. The diversification of the customer base and application areas also contributed to this growth.\n   - **Display**: The mobile panel business saw reduced earnings due to diminished smartphone demand, while the large panel business narrowed its losses through increased sales of QD-OLED for TVs.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**:\n   - The overall business environment was impacted by global macroeconomic and geopolitical issues, leading to an economic slowdown. Specific factors such as trade tensions, inflation rates, and currency fluctuations likely contributed to the weak demand.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**:\n   - The Memory business faced challenges primarily from a decline in ASP and inventory valuation losses, which negatively impacted revenue. For Foundry, the record performance was attributed to increased customer sales and capacity expansion, showcasing resilience in this segment.\n\n4. **Future Expectations**:\n   - While the transcript does not provide specific future guidance, the company is likely to focus on leveraging strengths in the Foundry business and high-end segments of the Display business to mitigate current challenges. The strategic direction may involve continuing to expand advanced node capacity and exploring new application areas to sustain growth.\n\nThese factors and insights align with the company's previous guidance, which likely anticipated some of these challenges but also highlighted areas of strength, such as in the Foundry business. The company is expected to continue navigating these challenges while capitalizing on its core strengths to drive future performance."

As you mentioned, with recent inflation, higher interest rates, consumer sentiment remains soft, also due to concerns of a weak economy going forward, even businesses, companies are placing top priority on maintaining their financial soundness, and this has resulted in a prolonged inventory adjustment cycle by customers that started from second half of last year.

And therefore, we think that the rate of high-density memory adoption will increase by around 20% year-over-year for both DRAM and NAND, and also, at the same time, we think that the adoption of DDR or migration to DDR5 will happen at the same time. Especially this conversion to DDR5, there are things to keep in mind, for example, because of the chip size penalty, bit productivity decrease is expected also because this is an initial new product, market inventory levels are currently low. And so initially, we can expect there to be build demand. And on top of that, demand to secure initial inventory.
