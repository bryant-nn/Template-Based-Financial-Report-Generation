So, could you give us a status update? Also more on your sub-2-nano road map and differentiation strategy for AI if you don't mind sharing.\\nJaejune Kim: Yes. Let me cover your question on memory performance first. In the second quarter, memory market continue to see strong Gen AI-driven growth with solid demand for server application. And so there were limitations in available capacity for us to respond to all incoming demand from our customers. So, given the position, we maintained our sales operations centered around profitability, while expanding the share of high value-added products, including HBM, server DDR5, and SSD to achieve qualitative growth across our business portfolio. Our ASP increased in part thanks to improved portfolio and a rising market pricing, and prices rose in the high 10% range for DRAM and low 20% range for NAND",

So as AI advances further, there will likely be countless on device innovation across computing, telecommunications, camera display. We own and continue to advance our key enabling technologies. So.\\nDaniel Araujo: So on your second question, we've consistently upgraded the hardware in our S Series to deliver industry-leading experiences to customers, and we'll continue to enhance key experiences as well upgrade hardware so that we can offer top performance. For camera and display specs in particular, where we've been leading, the S25 at launch will have top-of-the-line upgrades. And we're also preparing industry-best APs and memory to boost AI performance and offer an overall premium experience.

Across the industry, there's a lot of investment in terms of migration of existing nodes and lots of production constraints in place. So, given the conditions, what kind of CapEx plans do you have? And what's your supply strategy as well?\\nJaejune Kim: So, in terms of memory CapEx and supply strategy, let me cover this. So, following the second half of this year, we think next year, we will also continue to see very strong demand driven by Gen AI server application, whereas industry bit growth is likely to be constrained. For DRAM, a major boost in HBM ramp-up. Conventional DRAM based on advanced processes is expected to see a particular supply constraint. NAND was impacted by reduced CapEx which acts as a constraint last year, it is impacted by bit loss from the node migration of the existing lines. So, we expect"

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends suggest a continuation and possible intensification of the current trend of demand outpacing supply, particularly in advanced memory technologies like DRAM and NAND. Historically, the company has focused on profitability and qualitative growth by expanding high-value products like HBM, server DDR5, and SSD. The recent trend of ASP increases in the high 10% range for DRAM and low 20% range for NAND indicates a strategic shift towards higher-margin products.\n\n1. **Key Financial Details or Numbers**: Historically, the company's ASP increased significantly due to improved product portfolios and rising market prices. While specific revenue or profit figures from the financial statements are not provided in the context, these ASP increases suggest a positive impact on revenue and profitability.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance**: The company's strategy has been to maintain sales operations centered around profitability, which has been supported by expanding high-value products. This focus on qualitative growth aligns with the historical trend of increasing ASPs and suggests a strong financial position.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes**: The forecasted trends are driven by strong demand from Gen AI server applications, which is expected to continue into next year. Supply constraints, particularly in DRAM and NAND, are due to reduced CapEx and node migration impacts, which limit industry bit growth.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidances for Future Performance**: The company expects strong demand to continue next year, with potential for increased prices and profitability due to supply constraints. This suggests a positive outlook for future financial performance, with continued focus on high-value products and strategic investments in advanced technologies.\n\nIn summary, the company's historical focus on high-value products and profitability has positioned it well to capitalize on forecasted trends of strong demand and supply constraints, potentially leading to continued revenue growth and improved profit margins."

The smartphone market in the second half is expected to increase year-over-year with increased demand for premium products driven by growing AI demand and the launch of new products equipped with innovative features. However, the growth rate of the mass segment is expected to slowdown due to channel inventory buildup resulting from excessive sell-in during the first half by some vendors as well as shrinking sales and marketing activities caused by rising material costs. The market demand for ecosystem products is also expected to expand.
