I would like to discuss the IM division's Q2 results and outlook for the second half of the year. In Q2 2021, market demand is expected to have decreased quarter-on-quarter due to seasonality and a resurgence of COVID-19. For our mobile business, revenue decreased from the previous quarter due to the component supply constraint in the mobile industry and production issues at our factory in Vietnam. Under these circumstances, we strive to minimize the impacts by prioritizing critical products and regions, utilizing our global SCM capabilities to optimally rebalance supply. Meanwhile, products in our Galaxy ecosystem, including tablets, PCs and wearables, contributed substantially to the Q2 performance.

In the second quarter, the TV business faced a sales volume decline in the high teens percentage. However, the forecast for the third quarter anticipates a growth in shipments by a high single-digit percentage, suggesting a recovery.\n\nIn the memory business, the second quarter saw strong demand for DRAM and NAND, with shipments exceeding expectations due to increased investments and the launch of a new CPU. This was supported by higher-than-expected increases in average selling prices (ASP) and cost reductions from advanced processes. Looking ahead, demand from servers is expected to remain solid, driven by higher content adoption and cloud infrastructure expansion, despite uncertainties like geopolitical issues and IC supply volatility.\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, specific financial metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins, or earnings forecasts would be beneficial. However, the overall context suggests an improvement in market conditions and strategic positioning, with a positive outlook for the second half of the year."

                        "from laptops as online activities such as remote working and education continued. We achieved shipments that exceeded our bit guidance by actively addressing increasing demand for server SSDs and strong demand for mobile and client SSDs while expanding the sales portion of 128-layer 6th generation V-NAND. Now let's move on to the outlook for the second half. The market view for the second half is a mix of concerns and expectations. The spread of variant COVID strains requires urgent attention and supply issues of some non-memory chips are likely to persist and various geopolitical issues escalating, all of which are risk factors to market demand. Positively, however, we expect the fundamentals of market demand to be robust. First of all, in the case of mobile, along with the high-density trend for memory related to the expansion of 5G, launches of new models from major manufacturers bode well for demand. Furthermore, for servers, we expect enterprise investment sentiment to recover",
                        "demand was very strong in second quarter for both DRAM and NAND as many companies started to increase our investments. And also there was the benefit of the impact from the launch of the new CPU. And so we have responded to this by operating our product mix effectively to capture this strong demand. You've asked about the second half, and we think that the demand from servers will maintain solid in the second half. Even though there are many lingering uncertainties, including the possible spread of the variant virus, various geopolitical issues and some uncertainty and volatility around IC supply, we think that, first of all, there is an ongoing trend of higher content on server, especially with the adoption of the new CPU. And also, there is an increase of set build as, for example, the cloud-based overall infrastructure expands within the industry. And so given all of these factors, we think that fundamentally, server demand will remain solid in the remainder of the year.",
                        "the cloud-based overall infrastructure expands within the industry. And so given all of these factors, we think that fundamentally, server demand will remain solid in the remainder of the year. Specifically, regarding the server unit increase, we are expecting that on a year-over-year basis, server unit will grow at high single digit this year. Now to tap that strong demand from the servers, as you know, we are currently in customer sampling for our DRAM 14 -- DRAM that is using the narrow width circuit implementable at 14-nano for DDR5. We're expecting that to go into mass production as scheduled in the second half. Also, for the server SSD, we have a complete supply chain management formed, including in-house fab all the way to the controller. And so we are fully prepared to provide the stable and timely supply as a leading supplier for servers. To take your second question about our mobile production in India and Vietnam, fortunately, in the case of India, we have not gone through"

The company anticipates a high single-digit growth in server units on a year-over-year basis.\n\n2. **Mobile Sector Growth:** The expansion of 5G technology and the launch of new models by major manufacturers are expected to drive demand for high-density memory products. This aligns with the company's strategy to increase shipments of 128-layer 6th generation V-NAND.\n\n3. **Server Sector Demand:** An increase in server content, driven by the adoption of new CPUs and the expansion of cloud-based infrastructure, is expected to maintain solid demand for server products. The company is poised to capitalize on this with its upcoming DDR5 DRAM production.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements:** The transition to advanced technologies, such as 128-layer V-NAND and DDR5 DRAM, positions the company to capture demand with cutting-edge products.\n\nKey risks include:\n\n1. **COVID-19 Variants:** The spread of variant COVID strains could pose challenges to market stability, potentially impacting production and sales.\n\n2. **Geopolitical Issues:** Escalating geopolitical tensions could disrupt supply chains and market dynamics, affecting demand.\n\n3. **Supply Chain Constraints:** Persistent supply issues, particularly in non-memory chips, could affect the ability to meet demand. However, the company has a complete supply chain management in place for server SSDs, which could mitigate some risks.\n\n**Financial Context and Guidance:**\n\n- **Current Financial Performance:** In the recent quarter, the company exceeded its bit guidance for shipments, driven by strong demand in server and mobile sectors. This indicates a solid foundation for future growth.\n\n- **Projected Financial Metrics:** While specific revenue or profit projections were not provided, the company expects server unit growth in the high single digits for the year, suggesting a positive outlook.\n\n- **Guidance for Future Performance:** The company is optimistic about leveraging strong demand drivers to achieve favorable sales outcomes. It is preparing for mass production of DDR5 DRAM in the second half, which is expected to contribute to future revenue growth.\n\nIn summary, while there are significant risks, the company is strategically positioned to capitalize on robust demand drivers and technological advancements to achieve favorable sales outcomes."
