In Q2, continuing from the first quarter, we expect to see cost increases of major components for memory in particular. And there are also risks of rising geopolitical instability. In response, we're focusing on cost competitiveness throughout the R&D, manufacturing and sales processes to achieve solid profitability. At the same time, we're continuing to work on mix improvements including by boosting flagship sales through the expansion of models that support the LC AI, promoting upselling within our smartphone man and expanding sales of ecosystem products. Despite the difficult environment, we will continue to invest in AI, including AI R&D to strengthen and further mainstream",

So for bit growth, DRAM declined by mid-10%, NAND by a low single digit, but the rising ASP was actually above-market expectations, nearly 20% for DRAM, low 30% for NAND. So this helped turn around the memory business to profit for both DRAM and NAND. And due to rising pricing, we were able to write back positioning on inventory valuation loss, which also contributed to our profits. In the second quarter, we expect the business cycle to continue to improve, and the rising ASP trend is also expected to continue, and so we will maintain the same operational stance as we did in the first quarter. As inventory levels improve and amid limited available supply, we also expect most of the production capacity to be focused on HBM. So we expect additional supply constraint for advanced known"

In Q1 2024, Samsung reported a revenue of approximately $53.07 billion and a net income of around $4.89 billion, with a gross profit of about $18.78 billion. The earnings per share (EPS) stood at $0.719. The operating income for the quarter was approximately $4.88 billion, reflecting the company's efforts to maintain profitability amid challenging conditions.\n\nSamsung anticipates a slight dip in profitability in Q2 compared to Q1 and Q3, primarily due to anticipated cost increases in major components, particularly in the memory sector, and geopolitical risks. Historical challenges have included similar cost pressures and geopolitical instability, but Samsung's focus on cost competitiveness and mix improvements, such as boosting flagship sales and expanding ecosystem products, aims to mitigate these pressures.\n\nThe company expects the business cycle to improve in Q2, with rising average selling prices (ASPs) for DRAM and NAND, potentially enhancing profitability compared to previous periods. The ASP for DRAM is expected to rise nearly 20%, while NAND could see an increase in the low 30% range. This strategic focus on capitalizing on strong generative AI demand and improved ASPs suggests a proactive approach to sustaining profitability despite external challenges.\n\nFor future performance, Samsung's strategy includes investing in AI, enhancing its product mix, and expanding its presence in AI-based storage and server markets. These initiatives, alongside favorable market conditions for memory products, are expected to support long-term growth and profitability.\n\nOverall, while Q2 profitability is expected to dip slightly, Samsung's strategic initiatives and favorable market conditions for memory products may help maintain solid performance relative to previous quarters. The company remains focused on securing sustainable growth in the mid- to long-term, despite the challenging environment."

Next, I will share our market outlook and strategy for the second quarter and 2024. We expect overall market demand to continue to decrease as TV demand is projected to decline in emerging markets However, we believe there are still chance to achieve sales growth via opportunities such as global sporting events. We will work to secure profitability by increasing sales of strategic products with our differentiated launch of 2024 model and also by strengthening operational management in each business segment.

We expect the industry recovery trend to continue throughout the quarter, mainly led by the demand for generative AI. In particular, the continuous increasing supply of AI servers and subsequent expansion of our associated cloud services should increase the demand for HBM, which is directly linked with AI, but also conventional servers and storage in parallel. Therefore, we expect overall server-related demand to remain strong. And for mobile, as the [indiscernible] drive mainly led by Chinese OEM customers continues, demand is expected to be stable in the second quarter as well. However, for PC under the effects of low seasonality, it appears that in the second quarter, customers are likely to temporarily adjust. They have finished good inventory in the distribution channels in preparation for new product launches focused on on-device AI in the second half of the year. Thus, in the second quarter, it is",

And then conventional server replacement has actually been postponed for many years, but that is set to accelerate late transfer to new CPUs and we'll reach the replacement cycle. Likewise, for PC and mobile, a lot of the products that were sold early on during the pandemic are going to need replacement, and it will drive a decrease in on-device AI driven demand. For mobile, due to aggressive selling by customers in the first half of the year, there is a bit of increase in distribution inventory. So this may act as a constraint on set demand growth in the second half. On the supply side for the industry bit growth is likely to be limited for DRAM as most of the advanced process capacity is focused on HBM from generative AI demand, we think that non-HBM products will likely see constrained bit growth.
