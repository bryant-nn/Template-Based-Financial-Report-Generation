Second question is for a Samsung display. Competitors are also moving into the smartphone market, but you are continuing to record very good profitability. Do you think that you’ll be able to maintain your current profitability and competitive edge, and what kind of strategy do you have in mind for this year?\\nJaejune Kim: I’ll take your first question about the memory outlook for this year. While various geopolitical issues and macroeconomic trends need to be watched carefully going forward, I think, overall, the demand environment is expected to gradually improve, especially generative AI servers are adopting more HBM and DDR%. And in the case of NAND, we are seeing the 8 terabyte plus high density SSD demand coming in, which are all positive signals for memory demand. Also at the set level, PC and mobile are using the on-device AI as a new",
                        "answer your memory question. Fourth quarter overall there was the demand environment improvement and then there was also the base effect against the third quarter, where shipment was limited and so both our DRAM and NAND achieved bit growth of mid-30%. In particular, in the case of server DRAM, server DRAM recorded above 60%-bit growth Q-o-Q and also in Q4, our DDR5 migrated to 1A nano accelerated and now accounts for over half of our server DRAM driving overall DRAM bit growth. NAND environment is also improving and demand is coming in particularly around server SSDs for data centers and storage. And server SSD shipment increased by close to 50%, which is a huge jump on a Q-o-Q basis in sales. This year we are expecting demand recovery to continue around the cutting edge nodes and products, and we will leverage our competitiveness in advance nodes that we have acquired through investments to capture the market demand growth.

The company expects moderate improvements in the first half of the year and more significant improvements in the second half.\n\nHistorically, in the fourth quarter, Samsung's memory segment showed strong performance with a mid-30% bit growth for both DRAM and NAND. Notably, server DRAM recorded a 60% Q-o-Q bit growth, and server SSD shipments increased by close to 50% Q-o-Q in sales. These historical performances align with the positive forecasted trends, suggesting a continuation and potential enhancement of these growth patterns due to technological advancements and increasing demand in the server and data center markets.\n\nKey financial details from the Q4 2023 report indicate that Samsung's overall revenue was approximately $52.05 billion, with a gross profit of $16.19 billion. The operating income was $2.17 billion, and the net income stood at $4.63 billion. This financial health positions Samsung well to leverage its market share and capitalize on the growing demand for advanced memory products.\n\nSamsung's strategy to maintain its competitive edge involves fortifying its leadership in premium products and advanced nodes, preparing for future technologies, and capturing market demand growth through investments. The demand for technologies like HBM, DDR5, and high-density SSDs is driven by their ability to support the increasing computational needs of AI and data-centric applications, which are critical for the growth in server and data center markets.\n\nFor future performance, Samsung's management expects overall results to see moderate improvements in the first half of the year and more significant improvements in the second half, with a focus on cutting-edge nodes and products. However, specific guidance or targets, such as projected revenue growth rates or profit margins, were not detailed in the transcript."
