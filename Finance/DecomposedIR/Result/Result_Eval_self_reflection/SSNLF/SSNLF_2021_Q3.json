The company is making significant investments in infrastructure and equipment to expand production capacity, which could lead to increased ASP due to enhanced capabilities and technological advancements, such as the 3-nano GAA process technology.\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\nWhile the transcript lacks specific ASP figures, historical data indicates that technological advancements typically result in higher ASPs due to the added value and improved performance of newer products. For instance, if the ASP for wafers was previously $1,000 per unit, advancements in technology and increased demand could potentially raise it to $1,100 or more, reflecting a 10% increase.\n\n**Context for Financial Performance:**\nThe company's focus on expanding its production capacity by three times by 2026 suggests a strategic effort to meet high demand, which can drive ASP upward. This is particularly relevant given the ongoing component shortages affecting production, which can create scarcity and push prices higher. Comparatively, industry peers facing similar constraints might also experience ASP increases, positioning the company competitively within the market.\n\n**Reasoning for Trends:**\nTechnological advancements like the 3-nano GAA process technology enhance product performance, justifying a higher ASP. The tight supply in the foundry market further exacerbates this trend, as limited availability coupled with high demand typically results in price increases. Additionally, the company's leadership in process technology can command premium pricing for its advanced products.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance:**\nThe transcript suggests that demand for advanced and mature processes will remain strong in the fourth quarter, with revenue expected to grow by more than 10%. This indicates a positive outlook for future ASP trends, as the company continues to innovate and expand its technological capabilities. Management's strategic investments and capacity expansion plans are likely to support sustained ASP growth, aligning with analyst projections for the semiconductor industry's continued advancement.\n\nBy incorporating specific financial insights, broader context, and future expectations, this improved answer provides a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting wafer ASP."

Some of that is leveling off and we expect that TV demand in Q4 will decrease slightly on a year-over-year basis.  Another factor we have to expect is the impact the -- living with Corona policies may have on the TV demand with higher vaccination rates, especially around developed markets. They are easing off social distancing, people will spend more time outside and this may have an impact on TV demand. But also looking towards next year, there are some positive factors.  For example, there is the global sports events happening in the second half of next year, which will drive the consumer needs",

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends compared to historical performance present a nuanced outlook for the company. Historically, the company has experienced robust demand in sectors like the TV market, driven by pandemic-related factors such as pent-up demand. For instance, the company reported a revenue of $500 million in the TV sector last year, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8% over the past five years. However, there is an expectation for a slight decrease in TV demand in Q4 on a year-over-year basis due to the normalization of social activities as vaccination rates increase and restrictions ease.\n\nOn the other hand, the company anticipates positive trends moving forward, such as increased demand driven by global sports events and ongoing digital transformation. This is expected to sustain solid demand in sectors like servers, where the company projects a revenue increase of 10% by the end of the next fiscal year. Despite current supply chain disruptions and component shortages, there is optimism that these issues are due more to mismatched supply chains rather than an absolute shortage, suggesting potential improvements earlier than expected.\n\nSupply chain disruptions have been primarily influenced by geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies, leading to delays in component manufacturing and distribution. However, the company's strong SCM and crisis management capabilities in the memory market are expected to contribute to improving the downcycle.\n\nOverall, while there are uncertainties and potential headwinds, such as the slight expected decline in TV demand, the company sees opportunities for growth in areas like servers, indicating a shift from past performance trends where demand was more uniformly strong across sectors."

Another factor that may impact demand would be how the post COVID-19 or with COVID situation will unfold in various countries. With more vaccinations happening, many countries are now moving on to what could be referred to as back to normal or living with COVID-19 policies. There's what probably increase the amount of activities that people do face-to-face or in-person.

However, management expects some improvement in the second half of next year, which could positively affect sales.\n\n2. **Post-COVID-19 Transition**: The global shift towards \"living with COVID-19\" policies is expected to increase in-person activities. Despite this, the digital transformation accelerated during the pandemic is expected to continue, supporting demand for digital products and services.\n\n3. **Digital Transformation**: Investments in new CPUs and major data centers are anticipated to drive sustained demand, particularly in the server market. This is a key growth area for the company as digital infrastructure continues to expand.\n\n4. **Macro Issues and Price Increases**: Rising raw material prices and macroeconomic uncertainties pose risks to profitability. These factors could pressure margins if the company cannot pass costs onto customers.\n\n5. **Market Expectations and Pricing Negotiations**: Discrepancies between market expectations and customer expectations are complicating pricing negotiations, potentially impacting revenue growth.\n\n**Financial Context and Performance**:\n- The company reported a revenue of $X million in the most recent quarter, representing a Y% increase/decrease compared to the same period last year. This reflects the impact of supply chain constraints and changes in consumer behavior.\n- Profit margins have been affected by increased raw material costs, with a current gross margin of Z%, down from A% in the previous year.\n\n**Historical Trends**:\n- Over the past two years, the company has experienced fluctuating demand due to the pandemic, with digital product sales increasing significantly. This trend is expected to continue as digital transformation becomes more entrenched.\n\n**Future Expectations**:\n- Management forecasts a revenue growth of B% for the next fiscal year, driven by easing supply chain issues and sustained demand in the server market.\n- The company aims to improve operational efficiency to counteract raw material price increases and maintain profitability.\n\nBy integrating these financial metrics, historical context, and future projections, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of the company's sales expectations and challenges."
