Our fourth quarter results exceeded the high end of the financial range we provided in our last earnings call. Fourth quarter revenue was approximately $1.85 billion, which increased 9% sequentially, driven by higher wafer shipments, ASPs and non-wafer revenue. We shipped approximately 622,300 millimeter equivalent wafers in the quarter, an increase of about 2% on a sequential basis. ASP per wafer increased approximately 3% sequentially, driven by ramping LTAs with better pricing and overall very constructive transactional pricing environment and continued improvement in product mix. Wafer revenue from our end markets accounted for approximately 89% of total revenue. Non-wafer revenue which includes revenue from reticles nonrecurring engineering, expedite fees and other items, accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue for the fourth quarter,",

                    "init_answer": "The observed trend in wafer demand across different customer segments indicates a mid- to high single-digit growth in units over the next five years. This growth is measured in 300-millimeter equivalent wafers. The industry currently faces a supply shortfall in the mid- to high single-digit range, based on an industry-wide capacity of approximately 15 million wafers per year. Despite announced fab expansions, supply is expected to grow only around 4% over the next five years, or 2.5% if excluding China-based foundries. This suggests a persistent demand-supply imbalance, with demand growth outpacing supply increases.\n\n**Financial Implications and Context:**\n\n1. **Key Financial Details:**\n   - Unfortunately, the provided financial statement JSON lacks specific financial figures such as revenue or profit related to the company (GFS). However, the demand-supply imbalance could potentially lead to increased prices and higher revenue for companies that can meet the demand.\n\n2. **Company's Market Position:**\n   - The transcript mentions that GFS is closely monitoring capacity expansion and is cautious about adding capacity without confirmed demand. This strategic approach can help maintain or improve its market position by avoiding overproduction and aligning with customer needs.\n\n3. **Reasons for Demand-Supply Imbalance:**\n   - The demand growth is driven by technological advancements and increased semiconductor usage across various industries. Supply constraints may be due to limited production capacity and geopolitical factors affecting supply chains.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance:**\n   - While specific guidance from GFS is not available in the transcript or financial statement, the company is likely to focus on strategic investments and partnerships to address the demand-supply gap. This could include expanding its manufacturing capacity or collaborating with other industry players.\n\nIn summary, the wafer demand trend suggests a robust growth outlook, but supply constraints may pose challenges. GFS's strategic approach to capacity expansion and market monitoring will be crucial in capitalizing on these trends and potentially improving its financial performance."

And then as we're thinking about the linearity of the year, I know there's some steps when depreciation falls off and those sorts of things. Any sort of color, on how you see this year progressing quarter-by-quarter in the gross margin line? \\nDave Reeder: Sure. Well with respect to fourth quarter, the improvement to our guidance that we delivered, I think there were two things. One, I think the pricing and some of the expedites and some of this pricing associated with that was a little stronger than we expected. And then of course, fixed cost absorption, is a very, very powerful tool as an engine for accretion for a fixed asset business. And so we got better fixed",
                        "for letting me ask question. Congrats on the strong results. Tom I want to go back to one of the topics you hit on in the preamble about the supply coming on and how fast the industry needed to grow the supply to meet up to the demand and that disconnect. If I look at kind of the broad-based lagging edge companies, whether they're IDMs or fab-lite companies, their spending is exploding. Texas Instruments talked about it last week. So, as those companies are spending two, three times their 10-year average rate, do you view that as more of an endorsement of the growth of the industry, or are you in any way scared that that supply could lead to pricing declines pressure on your customers? I know you have the long-term agreements, but just wondering how you reconcile these companies that aren't necessarily your customers also spending so aggressively?\\nTom Caulfield: Yes, remember they have to grow their business too. In our industry, you don't grow if you don't make more product, right?"

                    "init_answer": "To improve the financial report answer based on the feedback, let's address the points systematically:\n\n1. **Acknowledging Data Limitations and Providing Context**: \n   The historical financial performance data from the JSON is largely unavailable due to null values. This limitation restricts our ability to provide specific historical figures. However, based on the earnings call transcript, the company is experiencing strong demand and pricing power, particularly in the home and industrial IoT space. The focus on fixed cost absorption and capital intensity indicates a strategic emphasis on scaling operations, which suggests a positive outlook.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**:\n   The company is strategically positioned in the IoT market, which is experiencing significant growth. This positioning has allowed the company to capitalize on high demand and implement price increases. Historically, the company has undergone a strategic pivot to focus on this segment, which appears to be paying off as they report being \"very pleased\" with their progress.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**:\n   The favorable trends in demand and pricing are likely driven by broader market conditions, such as increased adoption of IoT technologies and industrial automation. The company's ability to manage fixed costs effectively is a key driver of margin improvement, as mentioned in the transcript. This differs from past performance where such strategic focus and market conditions may not have been as favorable.\n\n4. **Expectations and Guidance**:\n   While specific numerical guidance is not provided in the transcript, the company expresses optimism about future performance. They anticipate continued strong demand and have secured long-term agreements, which should stabilize revenue streams. The mention of high capital intensity suggests ongoing investments in capacity expansion to meet future demand, which could lead to revenue growth and improved profitability.\n\nIn summary, while historical financial data is unavailable, the company's strategic initiatives and current market conditions suggest a positive outlook. The focus on IoT, effective cost management, and capacity expansion are expected to drive future growth and profitability, marking a potential improvement over past performance."

How fast can we add capacity while demand continues to grow back to an industry that will double in eight to 10 years? And so for me, the way I think about this short of some kind of big macroeconomic event that will slow down all economies including our industry. I think for the better part of the next five years, we'll be chasing to put capacity on not demand and doing everything we can to get a better balance. It doesn't mean, it doesn't get better. But it doesn't mean, it gets fixed and we're in a position where we have more supply than we know what to do.\\nChris Caso: Got it. Thank you. As a follow-up David you -- there was very good leverage on fall-through from the incremental revenue. I think you spoke about 54% of the incremental revenue fell-through.

We chose to be very end-market-focused not just automotive, but all the way down to a particular device and make sure that we in our front end of our business really understood what were the features, not feature, features that really made the best winning product the real differentiated product.

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the financial report answer based on the provided feedback, here is a revised version:\n\nThe key drivers influencing future sales expectations for the company include:\n\n1. **Capacity Expansion**: The company is focused on rapidly expanding its capacity to meet the growing demand, which is anticipated to double in the next eight to ten years. This expansion is critical to capturing market opportunities and sustaining sales growth.\n\n2. **Operational Leverage**: The company has achieved a 54% fall-through from incremental revenue, showcasing strong operational leverage. This indicates that a significant portion of additional revenue is contributing to profitability, which is expected to continue as a driver of financial performance.\n\n3. **Fixed Cost Efficiency**: Improving the efficiency of fixed costs is a strategic priority. By optimizing the use of its fixed cost base, the company aims to enhance profitability and maintain competitive pricing.\n\n4. **End-Market Focus**: The company's strategy to concentrate on specific end markets and devices, ensuring that its products meet differentiated needs, helps maintain pricing power and drive sales growth. This approach is crucial for sustaining its competitive advantage.\n\n5. **Strong Demand Environment**: The demand environment is robust across various end markets, with anticipated revenue growth in the high-teens percentage range. This growth is supported by shipment volumes and an optimistic ASP (Average Selling Price) outlook.\n\nKey risks include:\n\n1. **Supply Chain Constraints**: Delays from equipment suppliers and extended lead times pose a risk to timely capacity expansion, potentially impacting the ability to meet demand.\n\n2. **Pricing Pressures**: There is a risk that the current pricing strength, driven by supply shortages, may decrease once these shortages are resolved, affecting the company's pricing strategy.\n\n3. **Macroeconomic Events**: A significant macroeconomic downturn could negatively impact demand across all industries, including this one, posing a risk to sales expectations.\n\nTo provide a clearer picture of the company's financial performance, it would be beneficial to include specific financial figures such as current revenue, profit, and historical performance metrics. Additionally, offering detailed explanations of strategic initiatives and specific future performance targets or guidance would enhance stakeholders' understanding of the company's financial outlook."
