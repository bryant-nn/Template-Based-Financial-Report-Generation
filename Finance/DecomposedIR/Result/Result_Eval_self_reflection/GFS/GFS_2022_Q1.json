This represented a 37% year-over-year increase, exceeding the high end of previous guidance, driven by a 14% increase in wafer shipments and a 19% rise in average selling prices. Improvements in product mix and fixed cost absorption also contributed. For Q2 2022, revenue is projected between $1.955 billion and $1.985 billion, with non-wafer revenue expected to decrease to 8.5%. Management attributes these results to strategic initiatives like better pricing, product focus, and cost management, with future expectations of stable demand and minimal inflationary impact.",

However, it mentions that wafer revenue accounted for approximately 90% of total revenue, and non-wafer revenue accounted for approximately 10%. Given the adjusted gross profit of $490 million and an adjusted gross margin of 25.3%, we can infer that total revenue was approximately $1.937 billion for Q1 2022. This is calculated by dividing the adjusted gross profit by the adjusted gross margin (i.e., $490 million / 0.253).\n\n**Comparative Analysis:**\n- Year-on-Year (YoY) Comparison: The transcript highlights an 18 percentage point improvement in adjusted gross margin compared to the previous year. This improvement was driven by better fixed cost absorption, higher average selling prices (ASPs), and an improved product mix.\n- Quarter-on-Quarter (QoQ) Comparison: The transcript does not provide specific QoQ revenue comparisons. For detailed QoQ analysis, actual revenue figures from the previous quarter would be needed, which are not available in the provided data.\n\n**Broader Context:**\n- The improvement in gross margin and strategic focus on product mix and ASPs suggests strong operational efficiency and market adaptability. However, without industry benchmarks or competitor data, a direct market position comparison is not possible.\n\n**Future Guidance:**\n- For Q2 2022, the company expects total revenue to be between $1.955 billion and $1.985 billion. Non-wafer revenue is expected to account for about 8.5% of total revenue.\n- The company projects adjusted gross profit for Q2 to be between $503 million and $531 million, with adjusted operating profit expected between $272 million and $305 million.\n- Operating expenses are anticipated to increase slightly due to higher labor expenses and enterprise IT projects.\n\nBy including these elements, the financial report provides a clearer, more comprehensive view of the company's financial performance and future expectations."

When I mentioned 2% of total revenue, it is really the impact on the P&L itself. So in other words how much impact would that have at the margins at the bottom. And so really, we were just communicating that, as we had set up all these LTAs and contemplated these contracts, we were working in the background to lock in the materials at fixed volumes, fixed prices. We were working on variability in our labor pay, and of course, we were hedging against some of the commodity exposure that we have on input prices, into your energy sources.

This is expected to decrease slightly to about 8.5% in Q2 2022. While specific revenue figures for Q1 are not provided in the JSON data, it's important to note that these percentages indicate a significant portion of their revenue stream.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - The non-wafer revenue, particularly the radical line, shows variability due to factors such as timing of design wins and manufacturing schedules. This variability is a crucial part of the company's revenue composition. The management has highlighted that expedite fees remain stable, which contributes to a predictable revenue stream within this segment.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - The management has implemented strategies to mitigate inflationary impacts, such as locking in fixed prices and volumes for materials, managing labor costs, and hedging against commodity price exposure. These strategies are chosen to ensure cost stability and protect margins. Historically, such measures have been effective in maintaining financial performance amidst economic fluctuations.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidances for Future Performance:**\n   - Looking ahead, the management expects robust backlog coverage through the year, indicating a stable demand outlook. They anticipate that the overall inflationary impact on revenue will be less than 2%, thanks to their proactive cost management strategies. However, they have not provided specific guidance on overall revenue growth or profit margins, but these strategies are likely to support financial stability. Future performance will also depend on the successful execution of strategic initiatives and market conditions.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the answer provides a more comprehensive view of the company's financial performance and expectations, aligning with the feedback for improvement."

The increase in shipments reflects the company's strategy to focus on differentiated process technology and accretive designs, which are likely to enhance profitability.\n\nIn contrast, demand in the personal computing segment is expected to decline in Q1 2022, comprising about 2% of total revenue. This decline is attributed to market normalization in low-end handsets and PCs, which are not strategic focus areas for the company. However, this segment is anticipated to improve sequentially throughout the year, potentially contributing less than 5% to total 2022 revenue.\n\nLooking forward, the company expects average selling prices (ASPs) to grow by about 10% year-over-year, which should positively influence financial performance.

While specific figures for overall revenue, profit, or earnings are not provided in the transcript or the financial statement JSON, it is clear that single source revenues are a significant component, representing about two-thirds of GF's total revenue.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance:**\n   - The growth in single source revenues suggests strong demand for GF's differentiated solutions, which likely contribute to higher margins. The increase in ASPs (Average Selling Prices) by 19% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter further supports the notion of improved pricing power and profitability.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends:**\n   - The growth in single source revenues can be attributed to the high differentiation of GF's solutions, such as FDX, SiGe, and RF SOI platforms. These platforms likely offer unique value propositions that drive customer preference, resulting in better ASPs and gross margins.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance:**\n   - While specific future guidance is not provided, the transcript indicates confidence in maintaining projected growth outlooks, supported by robust demand and strategic positioning in single source design wins. This suggests that GF expects continued strong performance in its differentiated segments.\n\nIn summary, while precise financial figures are not available, the qualitative insights suggest that GF's differentiated solutions and strong single source revenue growth are key drivers of its margin levels.

You've got weak China domestic smartphone demand which is impacting the low end of the segment. So on the strong June quarter guidance, Tom, given the commentary around weakness in mobile, so is your mobile business sustaining sequentially, given the supply demand gap by some of the customers in those segments or is your mobile business weaker sequentially in the June quarter, and it's just the diversification in the business is just allowing you guys to reallocate capacity to your non-auto segments where we know that demand is still strongly outstripping supply?\\nThomas Caulfield: I think we've got flat in sequentially in the kind of the high end handset in that space. Again, the low end",
                        "60-ish and 65%. I think near-term kind of quarter-over-quarter, right, we've talked about this fixed cost absorption and where you can increase capacity and output significantly at a facility. I think Dresden, Germany would be a great example, you can increase output from a facility in a very meaningful way, with a very minimal amount of input cost into that process. And so that's what's leading to the more near-term fall through. And then of course, over time, the steady state number that I was quoting kind of 60-ish, 65% that's the type of variable fall through that you can expect once we hit steady state.\\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Sukhi Nagesh for closing remarks.\\nSukhi Nagesh: Thank you, Sharon. Great, thank you everyone for joining us this afternoon. We look forward to meeting you on the conference circuit this quarter. Have a good evening.\\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now",

It's probably going to be shorter in duration and less in-depth given how it tied semiconductor to the world economy. I think, well you're going to see first would be consumer led, it would be a consumer led event for a macroeconomic event and then it would be consumer led on the semiconductor side. And I think that touches a lot of the end markets we spoke about.\\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it.\\nDavid Reeder: And if I could just chime in. When I think about future visibility, because there's an element of this question that when I did it I think about future visibility, they will, 2022, you know, Tom mentioned that lead times extended sequentially, they've actually extended year-over-year and sequentially book-to-bill closer to 1.5 than it is to 1.

The transcript reveals that while there is weak demand in the low-end segment and disruptions in the premium market due to COVID-19, the high-end handset segment is expected to remain flat sequentially. This suggests a stable performance in the high-end segment, avoiding a decline.\n\nThe company's strategic diversification allows it to reallocate capacity to non-auto segments where demand remains strong, helping to offset weaknesses in the mobile segment. This strategic move is crucial in maintaining overall business stability.\n\nIn terms of historical performance, the absence of specific financial data in the provided JSON limits the ability to quantify past trends. However, the mention of extended lead times and a book-to-bill ratio closer to 1.5 indicates a strong order pipeline, suggesting robust demand compared to historical norms. This implies that the company is potentially performing better than in previous periods.\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, it would be beneficial to include specific financial metrics such as past revenue, profit figures, and growth rates. Additionally, understanding the broader industry trends and economic factors contributing to the observed trends would provide deeper insights. Lastly, incorporating any future guidance or forecasts from the company's management would offer a clearer indication of expected performance."

                        "environment is still strong, but I think we have to put this in perspective. We'll talk about the small pockets, I'll reiterate some of the small pockets of softness we're seeing. When we started this year, we had demand that was 25% higher than the capacity we can fulfill. And so we're weighing an over demand situation. So I think holistically for the industry there's not like you're either in supply alignment or you're not, there's ranges of that and we were really as an industry and particularly GF having a lot more demand than we can satisfy. So we don't have high exposure to the PC market. We don't have higher exposure to the low end handset market. So there is a little bit of softening that we are seeing there. We're taking it as an opportunity to close some of that big gap that we started this year with, to feed the customers in a more strategic end market for us.\\nDavid Reeder: Yes, let me just add on Harlan. We're expecting total wafer shipments to grow kind of high single",

I guess just on the end markets, can you give us any sense of Q2 guidance by end market? And I guess embedded in that, you've been posting some pretty nice sequential revenue growth, but it's dropping markedly in Q2. Is that just because of the weakness in handsets and PCs or is there something else going on there?\\nThomas Caulfield: Yes, I think obviously, we guide at the enterprise level, but when we look sequentially from Q1 to Q2 as well as Q2 2022 to Q2 2021, the areas that we've highlighted for growth this year continue to remain the areas that are driving outsized gains for us. And specifically, I'd point to home and industrial IoT, I would point to comms, infrastructure and data center. And then on a year-over-year basis and a little lumpy, because it's a smaller number, I'd point to automotive. And those segments of the market for us continue to perform. Those",
                        "notably low-end handsets and PCs. As previously communicated, neither of these markets are areas of strategic focus for GF, with the exception of a few applications in these end markets that require unique and differentiated technology. In summary, the demand environment is largely as we expected, and our revenue visibility remains strong. It's backed by multiyear long-term customer agreement. We remain fully sold out in 2022 and 2023 and we are increasingly confident that we can deliver the long-term business model we outlined and articulated in our roadshow. With that as context, let's move on to our first quarter results. We are pleased to report another quarter of record results for the company. First quarter revenue grew 37% year-over-year and was driven by year-over-year increases in both wafer shipments and ASP. This, coupled with strong operational execution across all our fabs resulted in significant improvements to adjusted gross margin, which increased to 25%. This is an"

These areas are expected to continue driving growth, supported by multiyear long-term customer agreements ensuring revenue visibility and a sold-out status for 2022 and 2023. In Q1 2022, the company reported a 37% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by increases in both wafer shipments and average selling prices (ASP), reflecting strong operational execution across all fabs and resulting in an adjusted gross margin improvement to 25%.\n\nThe risks impacting future sales include potential softness in the low-end handset and PC markets, which are not strategic focuses for the company. However, this is seen as an opportunity to address the existing demand-supply gap and better serve strategic markets. The company remains confident in delivering its long-term business model, as articulated in its roadshow.\n\nFor future performance, the company anticipates continued growth in its strategic markets, leveraging its strong demand and capacity alignment. However, specific revenue projections or profit margins for future quarters are not provided in the context. Historical performance, such as the 37% revenue growth in Q1 2022, sets a positive precedent for future expectations."
