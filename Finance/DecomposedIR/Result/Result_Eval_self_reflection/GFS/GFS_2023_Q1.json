            "summary": "The company reported a decline in Q1 2023 revenue, attributed to a 29% year-over-year decrease in the smart mobile devices segment due to reduced demand and inventory correction. Revenue for Q1 2023 was approximately $1.84 billion, reflecting a 5% year-over-year and 12% sequential decline, aligning with the guidance of a mid to high-single-digit percentage drop. Despite the challenges, an increase in the average selling price per wafer by 12% year-over-year helped offset some losses. The company anticipates modest sequential revenue growth throughout 2023, expecting a return to normalized inventory and demand levels later in the year, supported by strategic pricing and product mix improvements.",

Next, let me provide you with our outlook for the second quarter. We expect total GF revenue to be between $1.81 billion and $1.85 billion. Of this, we expect non-wafer revenue to be approximately 10% of total revenue. We expect adjusted gross profit to be between $498 million and $527 million.

However, the company has indicated that Q1 2023 revenue is expected to be the lowest for the year. The revenue decline for 2023 is projected to be in the mid to high-single-digit percentage range year-over-year.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance:**\n   - The Q1 2023 revenue decline is significantly impacted by a 29% year-over-year decrease in revenue from the smart mobile devices segment. This decline is primarily due to reduced volumes in the low-to-mid tier smartphone segments and an ongoing inventory correction in the broader smart mobile market.\n   - Broader market conditions, such as slower-than-expected recovery in demand and ongoing inventory adjustments, are affecting the company's performance. The company anticipates that the first quarter marks the low point in revenue for 2023, with a gradual return to normalized inventory and demand levels expected later in the year.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends:**\n   - The decline in the smart mobile devices segment is attributed to reduced consumer demand and the continuation of an inventory correction. Additionally, economic factors such as inflation and supply chain disruptions may also be contributing to the reduced shipment volumes and revenue.\n\n4. **Expectations and Guidance for Future Performance:**\n   - The company expects modest sequential revenue growth throughout 2023. For Q2 2023, total revenue is projected to be between $1.81 billion and $1.85 billion, with non-wafer revenue accounting for approximately 10% of this total.\n   - Strategic initiatives to support future growth include ramping up long-term customer agreements with better pricing and continued improvement in product mix. However, the return to more normalized inventory and demand levels is expected to occur more slowly than previously anticipated.\n\nIn summary, while specific Q1 2023 revenue figures are not available, the company is focused on overcoming current challenges and achieving sequential growth in subsequent quarters, supported by strategic pricing and product mix improvements."

This was anticipated based on historical seasonality and specific customer orders. The company observed a modest decrease in inventories during the first quarter, which is a positive indicator for the second half of the year.\n\nAlthough specific financial figures for the first quarter of 2023 are not provided in the JSON data, management has indicated that they expect modest sequential revenue growth throughout the rest of the year. This growth is anticipated as inventory levels normalize, although the process is occurring more slowly than initially expected. The second half of 2023 is projected to see a return to more normal seasonal trends, driven by reduced inventories and improved demand conditions.\n\nIn terms of industry context, the smartphone market has experienced persistent weakness, which has impacted demand. However, management is confident that as inventories come down and demand stabilizes, there will be a gradual improvement in revenue.\n\nFor future performance, management expects continued sequential revenue growth, with the second half of 2023 marking a return to more typical seasonal trends. They are closely monitoring customer demand and inventory levels to adjust their strategies accordingly. While specific revenue targets or financial metrics for the remainder of the year are not detailed, the focus remains on achieving modest growth and stabilizing operations in line with market conditions."

In the first quarter, the smart mobile devices segment, which represented approximately 38% of the total revenue, experienced a significant decline of 29% from the prior year. This was mainly due to reduced shipment volumes and ongoing inventory corrections in the low-to-mid tier smartphone segments. Despite this decline, the company observed healthy demand in faster-growing segments such as industrial IoT, aerospace and defense, and automotive markets. These segments are contributing positively to the company's revenue mix, indicating a shift towards more industrial and specialized applications.\n\nFinancially, the company's total revenue declined by 5% year-over-year and 12% sequentially due to reduced wafer shipments, although this was partially offset by year-over-year improvements in average selling price (ASP) by approximately 12% due to better pricing and product mix. The company anticipates that revenue will decline year-over-year in the mid to high-single-digit percentage range, reflecting ongoing challenges in consumer-driven markets but potential growth in industrial sectors.\n\nLooking ahead, the company expects the demand in industrial and specialized markets to continue growing, driven by long-term agreements and partnerships that ensure competitive returns. However, the recovery in consumer-driven markets, particularly smart mobile devices, is expected to be slower, with normalization anticipated later in the second half of 2023. This outlook suggests a strategic focus on capitalizing on growth opportunities in industrial applications while managing challenges in traditional consumer segments."

Inventories are coming down, if you look on aggregate first quarter, we saw from an industry range modest decrease in inventories that bodes well for the second half, especially with certain customers are telling us they want to let the inventories come down. They -- more normalize how they're feeding the channels they want to get this past",

It seemed like you said that inventory should be pretty normalized, so I wouldn't expect them to go up that fast necessarily, but it didn't sound like anything was going to go down. So what's really the offset to the automotive growth?\\nDavid Reeder: Sure. When you think about the sequential growth in the back half of the year, really what you're looking at is you're hearing us say, when we say slide, you're hearing us say, we feel good about the industrial and the governmental portion of home and industrial IoT. So that's the A&D as well as the industrial business and IoT. We feel good about automotive. We've taken a more cautious outlook on the low end of consumer as well as the lower end of the handset market. And so that's what you've heard us communicate is just the fact that we feel good about those markets, that on the",

I would say for our annual forecast for 2023, we've been working with those customers to take the economic value of those contracts preserve them as well as to ultimately enhance our value and deliver our long-term model. And so I think that's probably the most that I would add there. Tom, anything that, that you would add to that?\\nThomas Caulfield: Yes, a minor add to that. When you think of single source business, it's not -- if I -- if there's price elasticity, if I lower at price would I get more volume. The volume is the volume and the price is the price. And the question is how do you go work through an inventory correction like this? It's not let's go win share by price elasticity. That's the value proposition we provide to our customers. We have single source business differentiate. They can differentiate their products that we can be a better supplier to them in the great times and in the -- in inventory"

And so the way we think about pricing is we think pricing at the current levels is very stable, slightly up, and then you're going to bump around a little bit depending on what the mix of your business is. And so when you think about a year-over-year basis, that would lead you to the kind of double -- high-single-digit, double low-teens type of growth that you mentioned. And then as you get towards the back half of the year, you look at pricing that's relatively flat depending on exactly what the final mix is.\\nRoss Seymore: Got it. Thanks for that.

Based on more recent conversations with customers and our own internal models, we continue to anticipate that the first quarter revenue will represent the low point of our 2023 quarterly revenue, and that will have quarter-to-quarter modest sequential growth throughout the year.

This sector alone is expected to contribute to slight sequential growth in the latter half of the year.\n\n2. **Inventory Normalization**:\n   - Inventory levels are projected to normalize in the second half of 2023, leading to modest sequential revenue growth. This normalization is expected to support a return to more stable demand trends.\n\n3. **Customer Demand and Orders**:\n   - Customer conversations indicate a gradual return to normal demand levels, albeit slower than previously forecasted. This gradual recovery is expected to positively impact sales in the latter half of the year.\n\n**Risks**:\n\n1. **Weakness in the Smartphone Market**:\n   - Persistent weakness in the smartphone market, as indicated by a large customer, could dampen sales expectations and affect overall growth.\n\n2. **Continued Inventory Challenges**:\n   - Any delays in inventory normalization could impact sales growth negatively, despite the anticipated improvements.\n\n3. **Sector-Specific Demand Variability**:\n   - Variability in demand across sectors like smart mobile devices, communications infrastructure, and consumer electronics could pose risks to achieving expected sales growth.\n\n**Financial Context and Expectations**:\n\n- **Projected Growth**:\n  - The company expects high-single-digit to low-teens percentage growth year-over-year, driven by stable pricing and automotive sector performance.\n\n- **Recent Financial Performance**:\n  - While specific figures for Q1 2023 are not provided in the JSON, the company anticipates Q1 to represent the low point in revenue for 2023, with subsequent quarters showing modest sequential growth.\n\n- **Guidance for Future Performance**:\n  - The company expects a return to normalized inventory and demand levels in the second half of 2023, which should align with historical seasonal trends. This is expected to contribute to a gradual improvement in financial performance.\n\nBy including these specific financial expectations and contextual details, the response provides a clearer picture of the company's future sales expectations and the factors influencing them."
