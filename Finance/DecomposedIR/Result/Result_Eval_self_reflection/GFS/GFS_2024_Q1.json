            "summary": "For Q1 2024, the company reported revenue of $1.549 billion, marking a year-over-year decrease of approximately 2%, mainly due to reduced shipments as customers draw down inventory. However, this decline was partially offset by higher average selling prices and growth in premium tier mix and 5G RF front-end content. The automotive segment grew by 48% year-over-year, driven by increased semiconductor content in vehicles, while the communications infrastructure and data center segment saw a 66% revenue drop due to declining volumes. The revenue aligned with previous guidance, as the gross profit of $405 million exceeded expectations. Management expects Q1 to be the revenue low point for 2024, with sequential growth anticipated in subsequent quarters, driven by improved utilization, cost efficiencies, and strategic customer engagements.",

A significant positive impact came from customer volume adjustments, contributing $82 million to the revenue. The automotive segment experienced substantial growth, with revenue increasing approximately 48% year-over-year. This growth was primarily due to higher volumes and increased semiconductor content and features in vehicle architectures, even though there were reductions in average selling prices (ASP) and mix. Automotive revenue accounted for about 17% of the total revenue for the quarter.\n\nConversely, the communications infrastructure and data center segment faced a significant decline, with revenue dropping approximately 66% year-over-year. This decline was attributed to decreasing volumes, although ASP and mix remained stable in this segment. This segment represented about 8% of the quarter's total revenue.\n\nThe revenue outcomes were aligned with previous guidance, as indicated by the gross profit of $405 million, which exceeded the high end of the guidance range. This was supported by the customer volume adjustments. Looking ahead, the company expects further customer volume adjustments, which have been incorporated into the guidance for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nIn terms of broader market context, the company is navigating a challenging environment with supply chain issues and economic conditions impacting various segments differently. The automotive sector's growth aligns with increasing demand for semiconductor content in vehicles, while the communications infrastructure and data center segment is facing headwinds due to declining volumes.\n\nFor future performance, the company anticipates continued growth in the automotive sector as it supports a diverse range of applications, including internal combustion engines and autonomous connected electrified vehicles. Specific guidance figures for the second quarter have been adjusted to reflect these anticipated customer volume adjustments, although exact figures were not disclosed in the provided context.\n\nBy incorporating these details, the financial report answer provides a clearer financial picture, context for the company's performance, reasoning for revenue changes, and expectations for future performance."

What is helping you kind of emerge from this roughly a quarter before?\\n And then you mentioned Q1 could be the bottom and I was hoping you could give us a sense for how you're looking at sequential growth through the rest of the year. Should we assume that Q3, Q4 can kind of grow the way you're growing from Q1 to Q2? Or are there other seasonal or mix factors we should keep in mind? \\nThomas Caulfield: Good morning, Vivek. Let me break the -- so the answer is yes, we're going to continue to grow quarter-on-quarter. Let me give you some context around that. So let's first start with overall inventory. Inventory, we look at it in 2 dimensions: Days of inventory and then absolute dollars of inventory. While in some cases, days of inventory has gotten worse, the actual dollar amounts have come down, and that's an important indicator. \\n And so clearly, as this year rolls on, more and more of this inventory will come down, especially in",

And then I guess as you think about the recovery into June and beyond, what are the key drivers that we should be focused on there? \\nThomas Caulfield: Look, I think this quarterly seasonality, those things, we don't pay a lot of attention to in this segment given the fact that it's a very long duration. What we're highly confident in is that this is a business that will continue to grow, not only in the out years, but this year, and meaningful growth in the mid- to high-single digits for us in 2024. \\n So we see it. We see it in the order book and we see it in our business plans. So I wouldn't read too much into a quarter and quarter down in automotive, especially given last year was a year of over $1 billion, growing from $375 million the year before. \\nSam Franklin: Do you have a follow-up, C.J.? \\nChristopher Muse: Yes.

How should we think about D&A and OpEx in '24 versus '23? \\nThomas Caulfield: John, go in reverse order [indiscernible]. \\nJohn Hollister: Yes. Yes. No problem, Mehdi. So D&A, roughly consistent. It's how we see that. We've drawn down our CapEx a fair amount. As we said in our prepared remarks, we see about $700 million as our estimate for the year, which is enabling tremendous growth in free cash flow and we're holding the view that, that can increase to 2x to 3x the free cash flow that we generated in 2023. So that's, that's positive. \\n As far as OpEx, just a quick reminder that we had a large credit in the fourth quarter related to the advanced investment tax credit. That was coming into SG&A."

And I want to go back to the kind of discussions that we're having with auto players, why that's different with some of the other end markets. \\n So what's unique about auto, these are long-term supply agreements. When they qualify a part, they're going to use it for 5 to 10 years. So having long-term visibility and long-term certainty on supply pricing is really important for automotive makers because they're making commitments for a long time. The discussions we started with them continue, but they continue in a different fashion. \\n Since we don't design and they don't design, there's a third party of one of our customers in the middle, and we sit down, collectively talk about what we're going to do to make sure they have the level of certainty and durability and supply for their future. In more markets that have much quicker product life cycles, what we're finding is the LTA durations don't need to be as long. It doesn't mean customers don't want LTAs, they just want",
                        "2024, we see a normalizing pricing flat year-on-year, '24 to '23. What that means is, one, the pricing environment remains constructive, and I don't think we're telling -- saying anything new here. You heard that from our peer foundries or competitors on their earnings call, that they see the same environment. \\n The second thing is a big fraction of our revenue is single source business. And so you really can do is service true demand. There's no elasticity in pricing. So more price doesn't give more opportunity. And so constructive environment, differentiated business, keeps the pricing, we believe, flat year-on-year 2024 to 2023. Changes quarter-to-quarter mostly mix related. John, would you add anything to add? \\nJohn Hollister: Yes, I would. Chris, I think it's important to not conflate absolute ASP with profitability as well. In other words, just because our products may have a higher ASP doesn't necessarily mean it would have higher gross profit. Obviously, it affects wafer",
