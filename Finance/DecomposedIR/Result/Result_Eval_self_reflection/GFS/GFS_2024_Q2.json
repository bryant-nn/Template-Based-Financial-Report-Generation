This marks a sequential increase of 5% from the previous quarter but a year-over-year decrease of 12% compared to the same period in the prior year. The decline in year-over-year revenue is primarily attributed to lower shipments and utilization levels, which were in the low to mid-70s.\n\n**Additional Financial Metrics:**\n- **Net Income:** The net income for Q2 2024 was $155 million, resulting in a net income ratio of 9.50%.\n- **Gross Profit:** The gross profit was $395 million, with a gross profit ratio of 24.20%.\n- **Operating Income:** Operating income stood at $160 million, with an operating income ratio of 9.80%.\n- **EBITDA:** The EBITDA was $562 million, with an EBITDA ratio of 34.44%.\n\n**Context and Explanation for Trends:**\nThe year-over-year revenue decline is attributed to lower shipments and utilization levels, consistent with the commentary from the previous earnings call. The decrease in shipments may be due to market conditions, competitive pressures, or supply chain challenges. However, the company noted improvements in average selling price (ASP) and product mix, driven by content growth in premium-tier smart mobile devices.\n\n**Future Expectations and Guidance:**\nLooking ahead, GFS expects inventory levels in the smart mobile device market to normalize, positioning the company to support customer demand as silicon content and features in these devices continue to grow. Additionally, the company anticipates meaningful year-over-year growth in automotive revenue for 2024, driven by increasing semiconductor content and features across vehicle architectures.

This indicates the company's profitability in its core operations.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**:\n   - The company's overall revenue decreased by 12% year-over-year, primarily due to reduced shipments and utilization levels in the low to mid-70s. This decline reflects broader challenges in the semiconductor industry, such as supply chain disruptions and fluctuating demand.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**:\n   - **Automotive Segment**: The 10% year-over-year revenue growth in the automotive segment is driven by increasing semiconductor content and features in vehicles. This trend is supported by the ongoing shift towards electric and autonomous vehicles, which require more advanced semiconductor technology.\n   - **Home and Industrial IoT Markets**: The 28% year-over-year revenue decline is attributed to customers reducing elevated channel inventories. This suggests a temporary downturn as these markets adjust their inventory levels to align with demand.\n   - **Aerospace and Defense**: Although specific figures were not provided, the mention of increased volumes indicates a growing demand in this segment, likely due to increased defense spending and advancements in aerospace technology.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance**:\n   - The company aims to grow its revenues to between $9.5 billion and $10 billion, which would allow it to balance free cash flow with investment in growth. This strategic goal suggests a focus on scaling operations and enhancing profitability.\n   - Management is investing in differentiation, particularly in new process techniques, to bring innovative features to the market. This investment is part of a broader strategy to capture emerging opportunities in the semiconductor industry.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of the wafer demand trends, the company's current financial performance, and its strategic direction for future growth."

In 2023, the company achieved $1 billion in automotive revenue, a threefold increase from 2022. This substantial growth is attributed to continued market share gains, and management remains optimistic about sustaining this momentum.\n\n2. **IoT Market**: Although the current performance details were not specified, management anticipates a longer-term recovery in the IoT market.

So really, we're not that dependent as maybe some of our competitors on the EV consumption. In addition, I just want to highlight that highlight the design momentum we have on 22FDX within the radar space, it really is becoming the technology platform of choice for radar. And we've had several very meaningful design wins in the last few months across 22FDX, and there'll be more about that later.\\nSam Franklin: Do you have a follow-up to that?\\nVivek Arya: On the topic of gross margins, how does your balance sheet inventory figure in the path of",

So the quality of earnings is quite high. And it looks like the main mechanism is CapEx underfunding depreciation expense. And if so, would you expect that to persist? And maybe if you could give us a framework for thinking about those line items in the cash flow statement depreciation and CapEx over the medium term, maybe into next year if you could.\\nJohn Hollister: This is John. So the company had invested in its capacity footprint over the past several years. And given the industry dynamics, we have the ability to leverage that and operate within that capacity footprint without a heavy amount of CapEx. That said, we are still investing in future growth. For example, our technology transfers into our multifab are continuing, and we continue to make investments around GaN and other items to drive forward growth. So we're excited about that. But,"

In the US, we're still dealing with high interest rates as a result of high inflation. And once those two economies get a little bit more normalized and consumers start to spend and redirect that spending back into electronics, I think that's when we're going to see our businesses as an industry pick up.
