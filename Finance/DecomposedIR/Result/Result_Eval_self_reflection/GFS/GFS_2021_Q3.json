We continue to forecast a decline in this end market for the first half of 2022 and then see stabilization as an improvement in the second half of 2022 from ramps from newer high-margin customer designs. We expect, however, the decline in revenue in this end market to be more than compensated with growth in other end markets. Next, I’d like to provide a brief update on our ongoing capacity expansion plans. Overall, our global installed capacity will increase approximately 4% from 3Q to 4Q, which is approximately 12% increase from the fourth quarter of last year. Our installed capacity in our Fab 1 facility in Dresden, Germany, is increasing output by approximately 16% from 3Q to 4Q this year, and this also represents about a 15% expansion at the facility from a year ago. All of this expansion in capacity is in support of customer demand"

I look at the pricing in those LTAs, which is really pretty flat. So kind of step function up and then pretty flat as those LTAs ramp kind of throughout 2022 and even parts of 2023. This looks like a long-term trend to me, and that’s speaking specific to the data that I gave you.\\nChris Caso: Got it. Helpful. Thank you. As a follow-up, if you can make some commentary on CapEx where it is now and where it’s been going. It looks like it’s obviously up a lot year-on-year. From my numbers, it looks like it’s actually down a bit sequentially. You talk about where CapEx needs to run over the next couple of quarters in order to hit your customer shipment goals and maybe speak generally",

Our next question comes from Chris Danely of Citi. Please go ahead.\\nChris Danely: Yes. Thanks guys. And I’ll add to the line of congratulations. Just another question on end markets to follow-up to Joe’s question. So to be a little more specific on the sequentials, why was mobile flat sequentially? Was that pretty much in line with expectations? And then also why was the comm business up so much sequentially? And then any color you can give on guidance by end markets for Q4 would be great.\\nTom Caulfield: Dave, why don’t you take that one? I’ll add some comments.\\nDave Reeder: Sure. Look, smart mobile is, as you know, it represents about half of our total revenue. And we were expecting that business after good sequential growth from Q1 to Q2, we were actually expecting that business – it was up modestly. We’re expecting that business to be",

You talk about where CapEx needs to run over the next couple of quarters in order to hit your customer shipment goals and maybe speak generally about the availability of equipment, is the availability of equipment adequate to be able to support the ramp that you need to execute on?\\nTom Caulfield: Sure. So if you recall from the roadshow, we were talking about our CapEx over 2021 and 2022 roughly being about $2 billion in 2021, roughly $4.5 billion in 2022, again, all supported by those LTAs that we’ve talked a bit about on this phone call. For 2021, we’ll probably come in closer to about $1.9 billion, plus or minus $100 million or so depending on what comes in between now and the end of the month from an equipment perspective. And then we’re still looking good to roughly that $4.5 billion number for 2022. So from a CapEx perspective, I would say we’re largely on plan to what we spoke about in the roadshow. And so no real meaningful"

This suggests a positive trend in sales performance moving into the next quarter. The company also anticipates stable pricing due to long-term agreements (LTAs), which provide a consistent revenue stream.\n\nIn terms of capital expenditures (CapEx), the company plans a significant increase from approximately $2 billion in 2021 to around $4.5 billion in 2022. This indicates a strategic investment in capacity expansion to meet growing customer demands, as highlighted by the commitment to customer shipment goals.\n\nHowever, the financial statement JSON lacks historical data such as revenue, net income, or cash flow figures, making it impossible to directly compare these forecasts with past performance. The absence of specific historical financial metrics limits the ability to provide a detailed comparison of trends over time.\n\nFactors driving the expected increase in ASP and CapEx include market demand for products, the stability provided by LTAs, and strategic investments in infrastructure to support future growth. While the narrative suggests positive growth and investment trends, without historical figures, precise numerical comparisons are not feasible.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is well-positioned to capitalize on market opportunities through its strategic investments and stable revenue from LTAs. However, potential challenges such as equipment availability and market competition could impact future performance."

And for my follow-up, do you think that the supply chain is starting to get a handle on the shortages, especially in the automotive and the industrial space? Or do you think it’s still getting a little bit worse out there.\\nTom Caulfield: That’s a great question. I think, broad brush, say better or worse that there’s pockets where there’s maybe better planning and there’s a better opportunity. I would say that over the course of this year, we’ve closed the gap but it really started with a significant gap between the supply and the demand. And I think we’ve made as an industry as we have record shipments in all manufacturing, we’ve closed that gap, but nowhere near where it needs to be closed. I think that’s the closest I could come to give a broad-based answer to that. David, would you add anything to that?\\nDave Reeder: No. I think that’s well",

We’re expecting that business to be kind of relatively flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis on a sequential. And so the rest of the businesses, however, when we look at automotive up in a meaningful way, comms, as you mentioned, infrastructure data center up in a meaningful way and then, of course, home and industrial IoT also up in a meaningful way. If you think about the macro trends across those markets. Those are all markets that we expected to grow in a pretty meaningful way for us sequentially, and they did. Tom, anything that you’d add?\\nTom Caulfield: Yes. I’d add yes, I’d like – there is some timing between when the cyclicality of the smart mobile market and when inventory start to build, and there’s a little bit of that in play there as well.\\nChris Danely: Great.

I think we sit in a very unique position as a foundry where we get to see what’s going on in a lot of the end markets, in particular, the five we serve. And I have to tell you, not – anything noticeable from our seat from what we talked about in the roads show. We are still dealing with shortages of what we can supply to our key customers in 2022 and figuring out how we could produce more, how do we do the right balance and allocations. So there’s nothing that we see in the industry for 2022 that would suggest the frothiness that you described is changing. I have to tell you though I would welcome a little bit of the softening of demand just a little bit to make some of the closure of that gap. And so what we’re doing, I think, more importantly, is the investments we’re making over 2021 and 2022 to close that supply-demand gap for the industry. I hope that helps.\\nRoss Seymore: It definitely does. One then as a follow-up, for David"

This growth is expected to continue driving sales. However, specific financial figures such as revenue or growth rates for these segments are not provided in the financial statement JSON.\n\n2. **Supply Chain Dynamics**: The company is facing ongoing supply shortages, particularly in the automotive and industrial sectors. These constraints pose a risk to meeting sales expectations. The transcript indicates efforts to close the supply-demand gap, but no specific financial impact or timeline is provided.\n\n3. **Cyclical Trends in Smart Mobile Market**: The smart mobile market is experiencing cyclicality, affecting inventory levels and potentially impacting sales timing and volume. Again, no specific financial metrics are provided to quantify this impact.\n\n4. **Capacity Investments**: The company is making investments in 2021 and 2022 to increase production capacity and alleviate supply constraints. These investments could boost future sales if successful, but the financial statement JSON lacks details on the capital expenditure or expected return on these investments.\n\n5. **Financial Context and Performance**: Unfortunately, the financial statement JSON does not provide specific financial figures such as recent revenue, profit margins, or earnings, which are essential for understanding the company's current financial performance and setting a baseline for future expectations.\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, it would be beneficial to have access to quantitative data such as recent revenue figures, profit margins, or earnings, and to compare these against previous periods or industry benchmarks. Additionally, providing quantitative guidance or forecasts for future performance, such as expected revenue growth rates or profit margins, would offer clearer expectations for stakeholders."
