Full-year automotive revenue grew about 30% year-over-year in 2022 and we expect continued growth in 2023. Based on our current design wins and ramp profile, we now expect almost $1 billion of automotive revenue in 2023. Next, our communications infrastructure and data center end market, where fourth quarter revenue grew approximately 27% year-over-year and comprised approximately 18% of the quarter's total revenue driven by a combination of better ASPs and mix as well as higher volume.

This aligns with the company's guidance that revenue growth for the calendar year depends on a second-half recovery and modest year-over-year Average Selling Price (ASP) growth. The company maintains its guidance of achieving over two times revenue growth from 2022 to 2023, driven by these factors. \n\nKey financial details are not available in the provided financial statement JSON, as it lacks specific figures for revenue, profit, or earnings. However, the company's strategy is supported by customer demand and manufacturing lead times, which provide visibility into upcoming quarters and support the expectation of revenue stabilization and eventual growth.\n\nThe broader market context suggests that the industry is forecasting a recovery in the second half of the year, which supports the company's expectations. The utilization rate, which affects gross margins, is expected to be in the mid-80s to high-80s in the first quarter, down from the mid-90s in the fourth quarter. This affects short-term revenue but is anticipated to improve with increased demand later in the year.\n\nFor future performance, the company aims to achieve greater than two times revenue growth from 2022 to 2023, with a focus on increased volume and ASP growth.

Customer feedback and industry forecasts support expectations for a second-half recovery.\n\n2. **Average Selling Prices (ASPs)**: Management expects modest year-over-year growth in ASPs, which will contribute to revenue growth. This is based on a positive pricing environment and strategic pricing initiatives.\n\n3. **Industry Trends**: Broader industry trends indicate a recovery in the semiconductor market in the second half of the year, which aligns with the company's expectations.\n\n4. **Utilization Rates**: Utilization rates, which were in the mid-90s in Q4, are expected to be in the mid-80s to high-80s in Q1.

Maybe because it was the end of the year, it was holidays. The NDAA National Defense Authorization Act was passed, I think it was last week of December, if not it was just the second to last week of December. And specifically in there, it highlighted that the U.S. government over the next five years, they want to not have any supply in anything they buy that has CHIPS from snack.

                        "about 150 basis points above their expectations were - I was wondering, Dave, if you could give us some of the puts and takes? And from what you're describing, seems Q2 revenue could be kind of at least flattish? And then if that is a scenario, then can gross margins continue to go up? Or is there anything on the utilization side or anything else that we should keep in mind to think of a gross margin trajectory for this year?\\nDave Reeder: Sure. Good morning, Vivek. I think when you think about gross margin, you obviously think about two big elements. One is ASP, which as we mentioned, we believe ‘23 will have modest ASP growth over 2022. And then the second element is really what you touched upon, which is utilization. So, in the fourth quarter, utilization was in the mid-90s. For first quarter, we believe utilization is going to be, call it, the mid-ish-80s to perhaps the high-80s from a utilization perspective. And we previously talked about how every -- about every 5 points",
                        "we believe that that will be the driver for increased gross margin will be that utilization figure in that absorption. Did you have a follow-up?\\nVivek Arya: Yes, thanks. Second question is just in the premium smartphone segment, what's your view of how much of your customers’ component inventory is in the premium smartphone segment. Do you think Q1 is where it kind of clears out? Or do you think there could be a little bit that persists into Q2 and then there is a seasonal back half assumption? Just curious, if specifically in the premium smartphone segment, do you think we get to a supply demand balance exiting Q1? Or it could take until Q2 for that to happen?\\nDave Reeder: I think if you were to maybe be a little bit more granular and look at it perhaps a bit on a monthly basis, we think some of that inventory starts to get cleared out towards the end of first quarter, so call it in the March period and maybe it rolls over a little bit into the second quarter, maybe April, perhaps",
                        "first quarter, we believe utilization is going to be, call it, the mid-ish-80s to perhaps the high-80s from a utilization perspective. And we previously talked about how every -- about every 5 points utilization was about 2 points of gross margin from a mathematical perspective, that’s without necessarily taking a lot of actions. So I think sequentially what you're seeing is, you're seeing us move from about 30% gross margin in the fourth quarter moving to a midpoint in the first quarter of about 28%. And so, what you're seeing from us is you're seeing us actually make progress towards that gross margin bridge, but obviously it's being offset a little bit based upon the utilization. So as utilizations improve throughout the year and as we mentioned, we think first half is the bottom, then we believe that that will be the driver for increased gross margin will be that utilization figure in that absorption. Did you have a follow-up?\\nVivek Arya: Yes, thanks. Second question is just in"

However, from the transcript, we know that the gross margin was approximately 30% in Q4 and is expected to be around 28% in Q1. Unfortunately, without additional data, we cannot provide further financial metrics like revenue or net income.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - The transcript suggests that the company is facing a slight decrease in gross margin due to changes in utilization rates, moving from mid-90s in Q4 to mid-80s to high-80s in Q1. This indicates a potential decrease in operational efficiency, which might be affecting profitability. The company expects modest ASP growth in 2023 compared to 2022, which could help offset some margin pressure.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - The decrease in gross margin from Q4 to Q1 is attributed to lower utilization rates. Every 5-point change in utilization impacts gross margin by about 2 points. The company is working towards improving utilization, which should positively impact gross margins throughout the year. The expected ASP growth in 2023 is another factor that could support margin improvement.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance:**\n   - Management anticipates that the first half of the year will be the bottom for utilization, with improvements expected thereafter. This suggests a potential recovery in gross margins in the latter half of the year. The company is also monitoring inventory levels in the premium smartphone segment, expecting a clearer supply-demand balance by the end of Q2, which could further stabilize margins.\n\nIn summary, while specific segment or platform margin levels are not detailed, the company faces a temporary decline in gross margin due to utilization changes, with an outlook for improvement as utilization rates recover and ASPs grow modestly. The company is positioning itself for better performance in the latter half of the year, contingent on operational improvements and market conditions."

This is driven by significant growth in automotive processing, sensing, and vehicle infrastructure technologies, reflecting a year-over-year increase of approximately 30% in 2022.\n   - **Communications Infrastructure and Data Center Segment:** While specific guidance for the upcoming quarter or full year is not provided, the segment experienced a 27% year-over-year growth in Q4 2022. This growth was fueled by increased demand for network infrastructure and data center processing, indicating a strong market presence in these areas.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - The company anticipates overall revenue growth to exceed two times year-over-year from 2022 to 2023. This optimistic outlook is supported by robust performance in key segments like automotive and communications infrastructure, which are crucial to the company's revenue base. The company's strategic focus on high-demand technologies positions it favorably against industry peers.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - The growth in the automotive segment is attributed to technological advancements in vehicle infrastructure and sensing systems, which are increasingly in demand as the automotive industry shifts towards more connected and autonomous vehicles.\n   - In the communications infrastructure and data center segment, the demand for enhanced network capabilities and data processing power is driving growth. This trend is likely due to the ongoing digital transformation and increased reliance on cloud services and data centers.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance:**\n   - The company expects the first half of the year to represent a trough in revenues, with a recovery anticipated in the second half. This recovery is expected to be driven by increased volume and modest year-over-year increases in average selling prices (ASPs).\n   - Factors contributing to the anticipated growth include strategic design wins, ramping up of new technologies, and expanding market share in key segments. The company's ability to capitalize on industry trends and customer demands will be crucial in achieving its revenue targets for the year.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the revised answer provides a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial outlook, strategic positioning, and the market dynamics influencing its performance."

And so the way I would think about it is I would think about some of those CapEx is indeed a push out from ‘23 to ’24. And I would say there's a portion of it. I'm going to round and use a really rough and tough number here and say kind of maybe 10% to as much as 20% of it where we've actually just become more capital efficient. And so those savings will be banked to the P&L. And again, as I kind of mentioned earlier on the call, we are still very much on track to delivering the capacity that we've been speaking about for some time and that's 2.8 million wafers of capacity this year and then more than 3 million wafers of capacity in 2024. We are still very much on track even with some reduced CapEx and some timing of CapEx being slightly delayed. We are very much on track towards those numbers.

Good morning, Harlan. Maybe I'll start that one, Tom. And then if you have anything to on -- you can build at the end. And look, we do believe that first half is the trough. From a revenue perspective, we think it's most likely first quarter, but certainly from a first half perspective, we believe that, that is the bottom. Based upon what our customers are telling us based upon our LTAs and based upon I think what you all are seeing broadly in the industry most of the industry is currently forecasting a recovery in the second half of this year.
