The revenue decline was mainly due to reduced shipments to single-digit nanometer technology platforms and a 27% YoY decline in the personal computing market, driven by lower volumes. Despite these declines, the revenue exceeded the midpoint of the guidance given in November, with a gross margin of 29% at the upper end of expectations. The company attributed revenue changes to successful customer volume adjustments and a 127% sequential increase in PC revenue, although PC revenue still declined 27% YoY due to volume reductions. Management expects Q1 2024 to be the revenue bottom, with recovery starting in Q2 2024, supported by strategic initiatives focusing on durable end-markets and improved demand dynamics.",

Management expects Q1 to be the revenue bottom, with a recovery starting in Q2 2024 as inventory corrections progress and true demand surfaces. They anticipate improvements contingent upon strong consumer demand and easing inflationary pressures.\n\nFor future performance, management expects a gradual recovery in end markets, driven by strategic initiatives, leveraging long-term agreements (LTAs), and maintaining customer relationships.

So how do you see the profile of the business through 2024? And maybe an important consideration in a potential recovery, maybe the move of some of your finFET customers away from GF to single-digit, nanometer competitors and backfilling, remixing some of this rough customer business maybe a bit challenging in this environment, putting more pressure on multi utilizations, maybe"

For the full year, the company shipped approximately 2.2 million 300 millimeter equivalent wafers, an 11% decrease from 2022. In the fourth quarter, shipments were approximately 552,300 wafers, a 5% decline from the prior year period. The average selling price (ASP) per wafer remained flat for the full year but decreased by 7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, mainly due to changes in the product mix.\n\nFinancially, the company's fourth-quarter revenue was approximately $1.854 billion, a 12% decline year-over-year. Despite these challenges, the company maintained a gross profit of $525 million and a net income of $277 million, with a net income ratio of 14.94%. The smart mobile devices segment, which represented 41% of the fourth quarter's total revenue, saw a 7% decline from the prior year period, indicating weaker demand in this segment.\n\nThe overall semiconductor industry has faced headwinds such as market saturation and increased competition, which may have contributed to these trends. Additionally, macroeconomic factors, including high inventory levels among customers, have impacted demand.\n\nLooking forward, the company has not provided specific guidance for future performance in the transcript, but it is crucial for them to address these challenges through strategic initiatives, possibly focusing on diversifying their customer base and exploring new market opportunities to counteract the current demand pressures."

So what happened, if you found ourselves with excess inventory? And then everybody brought them into very down, they're not. So I think we're going to say now is, the recovery is going to be proportional to how quickly, things went down in our industry because in certain end markets, we've seen people, the end customers, the OEMs taking are place quite low and so everybody who predicts the future has a great chance of being wrong.

Thank you. \\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \\nChris Caso: Yeah, thank you. Good morning. I guess, the first question is, on gross margins and obviously a lot of moving parts as we go through the year and dependent - will be dependent on the pace of that recovery. But if you could give us some color on, what the puts and takes are as we look at gross margins as we go through the year? And you did mention that you believe that Q1 would be the revenue bottom. Do you believe that holds for gross margin as well? \\nJohn Hollister : Yeah, Chris, this is John. Similar to the prior comments, is gross margin is very much influenced by factory utilization. There are other factors that work clearly with mix, as well as",

[Indiscernible] top-line in the revenue. \\nThomas Caulfield: Yeah, I'll take, I'll take a second part of that question, but when you think about first order, as you as you know, we don't guide by end market. But I'll give you a little bit of color. We're expecting automotive to be better than that average you referenced about 18% down from Q to Q sequentially, Q4 to Q1 automotive flow will average us up. In other words, it'll be better than that average decline. We're expecting smart mobile devices to be better than that average decline. I'd reference that we expect both of those to actually grow on a year-over-year basis and certainly be better than that average decline sequentially.  Obviously, that implies that the other segments will be down a little bit more than that average which will ultimately get you to that down Q to Q about"

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends suggest a cyclical recovery in the industry, consistent with historical patterns where significant downturns are followed by rebounds. The company anticipates that Q1 will be the revenue bottom, with specific segments like automotive and smart mobile devices expected to perform better than average declines and even show year-over-year growth. This aligns with historical trends where certain segments lead the recovery.\n\n**Key Financial Details for Q4 2023:**\n- **Revenue:** $1.854 billion\n- **Gross Profit:** $525 million\n- **Gross Profit Ratio:** 28.3%\n- **Net Income:** $277 million\n- **Net Income Ratio:** 14.9%\n- **Free Cash Flow:** $379 million\n\n**Context and Explanation:**\nThe industry has experienced a steep decline, likely due to excess inventory and reduced demand, common challenges in cyclical industries. The company expects a recovery proportional to the decline, driven by inventory adjustments and demand stabilization. The focus on automotive and smart mobile devices is likely due to their resilience and growth potential in the current market environment. Strategic initiatives and market conditions favor these segments, contributing to their expected outperformance.\n\n**Future Expectations:**\nWhile specific guidance for future quarters is not provided, the expectation is that Q1 will mark the revenue low point, with improvements thereafter. The company's stable profitability, as indicated by the gross and net income ratios, along with strong cash flow management, positions it well for leveraging the anticipated recovery. For a more comprehensive outlook, specific revenue or earnings projections for future quarters would be beneficial, but the current context suggests cautious optimism for a rebound in line with historical recovery patterns."

In light up all the factors Tom mentioned, see a relatively stable and constructive pricing environment taking into account companies to appreciation features, the high percentage of sole source and talk about two thirds of the business in the prepared commentary, as well as this our principle that are provided a long term agreement. So overall, like-for-like we see a distressed pricing environment. \\nDavid Reeder : Hey John, it's just not to put it long, but if you think about it, when you sole source it, we go into service to demand, you can't use pricing to create more demand. So the bad is you can't create more demand.

The recent inventory level is $1.487 billion, which needs careful monitoring to align with demand fluctuations.\n   - **Sole Sourcing**: With about two-thirds of the business being sole-sourced, the company benefits from stable demand and pricing. However, this also limits flexibility in adjusting to market changes through pricing strategies.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance**:\n   - **Revenue Growth**: Given the stable pricing environment and sole-sourcing strategy, the company might expect moderate revenue growth, contingent on the cyclical recovery pace and effective inventory management.\n   - **Market Demand**: The focus on creating winning solutions will be crucial for capturing market demand and driving sales. The company's ability to innovate and meet customer needs will influence future performance.\n   - **Forward-Looking Statements**: While the company does not provide specific forecasts, the emphasis on unpredictability suggests that external factors could significantly impact future sales.
