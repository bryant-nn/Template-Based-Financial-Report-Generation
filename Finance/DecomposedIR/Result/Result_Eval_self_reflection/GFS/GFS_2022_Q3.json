This growth was driven by a 5% rise in wafer shipments and a 14% increase in the average selling price per wafer, supported by long-term customer agreements and an improved product mix. The company also received a $30 million government grant for its GaN RF technology. Despite macroeconomic challenges, the company's diverse market presence and strong product portfolio contributed to its positive performance. For the fourth quarter, revenue guidance was set between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion, reflecting a stable quarter-over-quarter outlook. Management plans to reduce operating expenses by $200 million annually to sustain growth and maintain competitiveness.",

This exceeded the high end of the financial range provided in the previous quarterly update. The increase in revenue was attributed to strong execution across various end markets and the strength of the company's product portfolio. The company also benefited from a $30 million grant from the U.S. government for its GaN RF technology offering. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, the company was well-positioned due to its single-source business nature and the breadth of markets it serves.\n\n### Key Financial Details:\n- **Revenue:** $2.074 billion for Q3, a 22% increase year-over-year.\n- **Government Grant:** $30 million for GaN RF technology.\n- **Operating Expenses:** Approximately $900 million to $1 billion, with plans to reduce by $200 million annually.\n\n### Context and Performance:\nThe company's strong performance was driven by robust execution across diverse end markets, including those with strong customer segments. The breadth of markets and the strength of the product portfolio, particularly in specialty areas, were significant contributors. The company's single-source business model provided a competitive edge, allowing it to navigate economic challenges effectively.\n\n### Trends and Changes:\nThe single-source business model and market breadth enabled the company to capitalize on strong segments, leading to increased revenue. The government grant also played a role in bolstering financial performance. Strategic initiatives, such as expanding the footprint and focusing on specialty products, supported growth.\n\n### Future Expectations:\nFor the fourth quarter, the company guided revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion, suggesting relatively flat quarter-to-quarter growth. Potential risks include macroeconomic uncertainties and shifts in demand. However, the company is investing in strategic areas and operational efficiencies to sustain growth. The planned reduction in operating expenses by $200 million annually is part of these efforts to improve financial performance and maintain competitiveness."

These agreements have been gradually implemented throughout 2022 and are expected to continue ramping into 2023, contributing to the ASP increase.\n\n2. **Pricing and Mix Benefits:** The ASP uplift is influenced by both like-for-like pricing changes and mix benefits.

                    "init_answer": "To address the feedback and enhance the analysis of wafer demand trends across different customer segments, here is the revised answer:\n\n**Revised Answer:**\n\nThe transcript and financial data highlight several key trends in wafer demand across different customer segments:\n\n1. **Smart Mobile Devices**: This segment represented approximately 46% of the third quarter revenue, growing about 12% year-over-year. Given the total third quarter revenue of approximately $2.074 billion, the revenue from smart mobile devices would be around $954 million. This indicates a strong and growing demand for wafers in the smart mobile devices sector.\n\n2. **Overall Wafer Demand**: The company shipped approximately 637,300-millimeter equivalent wafers in the third quarter, a 5% increase from the previous year. This growth in wafer shipments reflects rising demand across various customer segments, contributing to the company's overall revenue increase.\n\n3. **Pricing and Mix Improvements**: The average selling price (ASP) per wafer increased by approximately 14% year-over-year. This improvement is attributed to ramping long-term customer agreements with better pricing and continued enhancement in product mix. These factors suggest that customers are opting for higher-value wafers, positively impacting the company's revenue.\n\n4. **Inventory Correction**: The commentary indicates an expectation of a trough in mid-2023, likely due to the end of an inventory correction, particularly in the smartphone segment. This suggests a temporary slowdown in demand, but a rebound in utilization rates is anticipated in the latter half of the year.\n\n**Broader Context and Future Expectations**:\n\n- **Financial Performance**: The third quarter results exceeded the high end of the financial range provided in the last quarterly update, with a 22% year-over-year increase in revenue. Although specific figures for net profit, operating income, or EPS are not provided in the JSON data, the revenue growth and increased ASP indicate a positive financial performance.\n\n- **Market Position and Comparisons**: The company's strategic focus on long-term agreements and product mix improvements positions it well against competitors, potentially enhancing its market share in the semiconductor industry.\n\n- **Future Guidance**: The company expects 2023 to be a modest up year, with potential challenges such as inventory corrections being offset by strategic initiatives and customer agreements. The anticipated rebound in utilization rates in the second half of 2023 suggests continued growth in wafer demand.\n\nIn summary, the company is experiencing strong demand in the smart mobile devices segment and overall wafer shipments, with improved pricing and product mix contributing to revenue growth. Despite short-term challenges like inventory corrections, the company's strategic focus and customer agreements provide a positive outlook for future performance."

This growth was attributed to ramping long-term customer agreements and improved product mix.\n\n- **Reason for Revenue Range:** The guidance for the fourth quarter reflects a sequential reduction in capacity utilization, particularly in 200-millimeter fabs, which has impacted gross margin guidance by approximately $50 million. This suggests that operational adjustments and market conditions are influencing the revenue expectations.\n\n**Future Outlook:**\n\n- While specific full-year guidance is not provided in the transcript, the company expects 2023 to be a modestly positive year overall. This indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook, potentially supported by expanding long-term agreements and market positioning.\n\nIn summary, the fourth-quarter guidance reflects a slight decrease from the third quarter, with factors such as capacity utilization and market conditions playing a role. The company remains optimistic about its long-term growth prospects, driven by strategic agreements and market dynamics."

When you look at some of the growth we've had year-over-year, like at industrial and home IoT, over 80% growth, that's not a sustainable growth rate, right?

And so while we wanted more CapEx in the early part of this year and our WFE suppliers, they're working hard, were unable to supply us with everything that we needed. We were able to deliver productivity to continue to execute against the LTA commitments that we've made. And so we are banking those productivity gains. And we're now working with the WFE vendors to make sure that we get the critical pieces of tooling that are necessary to still grow the capacity for that customer demand. And as the demand changes, then we'll move and shift the capacity such that we can keep that capacity as best as we're able and in alignment with that customer demand. So our forecast has come down now for the year. Total CapEx for the year is somewhere between, call it, $3 billion to $3.3 billion. As we think about next year, you should think about us considering our free cash flow generation ability in context with our customer demand and trying to match up and align those",

That's helpful. And the second question I wanted to ask, I wanted to follow up the $200 million OpEx is quite sizable relative to the annual base. Just curious, given the plans to continue to grow the footprint, grow into more specialty, if you could give a few buckets where you're seeing good room to make those type of reductions. And then just one housekeeping. With the CapEx change, how you see the depreciation changing year-over-year into next year?\\nDave Reeder: Sure. So let me take those in order here. With respect to OpEx, we've -- rough and tough numbers, it's about $1 billion in OpEx, probably closer to $900 million, if you were to do the rounding $1 billion. So when you think about the split of the $200 million annualized, you're probably"

Historically, the company has experienced significant growth in segments like industrial and home IoT, with over 80% year-over-year growth. However, this is not sustainable long-term due to market saturation and limited supply capacity. The automotive market remains a bright spot, expected to continue outperforming and possibly avoid the cyclical downturns impacting other sectors.\n\nThe company is adjusting its capital expenditure (CapEx) plans to align with these changing market dynamics, reducing its forecasted CapEx to between $3 billion and $3.3 billion for the year. This cautious approach reflects a shift from earlier expectations, likely due to supply chain constraints and the need to optimize resource allocation amid fluctuating demand.\n\nOperating expenses (OpEx) are also targeted for reduction, with a planned $200 million cut. This reflects a strategic move to enhance operational efficiency and maintain financial health. Historically, the company's OpEx was approximately $900 million to $1 billion, so this reduction is significant.\n\nWhile specific revenue, profit, and earnings figures are not provided in the financial statement JSON, the company is clearly focusing on aligning its financial strategies with market conditions. The expectation is to continue leveraging growth opportunities in resilient sectors like automotive while managing costs and investments prudently in other areas.\n\nIn summary, the company is strategically adjusting its spending and resource allocation to navigate a complex market environment, with a focus on maintaining growth in key sectors and optimizing operational efficiency."

When times are more challenging, you tend to focus on the variables that you can control. And when we sit down as a management team and we think about those variables, the first one is the one that Tom mentioned, differentiation. So we've realigned the company to be more focused with respect to product management, development of differentiated technology. We believe we're making progress towards being more differentiated. We had another quarter, about 90% of our design wins were single sourced. We're about 90% for the year, year-to-date, on design wins being single source.

I think you mentioned the sort of annualized cost savings run rate of about $200 million. I was wondering if the time line to reach that cost savings run rate is sort of in the next couple of quarters?
