The QoQ decrease was primarily due to a 17.5% reduction in wafer shipments and over a 3% negative foreign exchange impact from NT dollar appreciation. The revenue aligned with the upper end of the previous guidance, which anticipated a 17% to 19% decline. The decline in wafer shipments was attributed to reduced demand in the computer, consumer, and communication segments, while maintenance activities also contributed to a lower base capacity. Despite these challenges, the company expects a gradual return to normal capacity and a potential increase in utilization rates moving forward.",

Although there was an increase in 28-nanometer capacity, which could potentially raise the blended base ASP, the overall impact is mitigated by the need to support customer competitiveness through potential pricing adjustments.\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\n- Revenue for Q1 2023 was $1.77 billion.\n- Gross profit for the same period was $628.54 million, with a gross profit ratio of 35.5%.\n- Net income was $529.10 million, with a net income ratio of 29.8%.\n\n**Context for Financial Performance:**\nThe company has maintained its market position by closely collaborating with customers to uphold their competitiveness. This is crucial in light of the mixed outlook, where the demand for certain products like the 28-nanometer is firming up, but others, like the 8-inch, are deteriorating.\n\n**Reasoning for Trends:**\nThe flat ASP is influenced by the product mix and the strategic decision to support customers in maintaining their market share. The increase in 28-nanometer capacity suggests a potential for higher ASP, but this is offset by the need to offer competitive pricing due to rising input costs.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance:**\nThe company expects the ASP to remain flat in the upcoming quarters, given the current product mix and market conditions. However, the firm is optimistic about certain segments like the 28-nanometer, which could present opportunities for growth if market recovery signs solidify. Potential risks include continued raw material cost increases and unfavorable economic conditions, which could pressure pricing strategies further.\n\nIn summary, while the wafer ASP remains stable for now, the company's focus on customer competitiveness and market adaptability will be critical in navigating future financial performance."

                    "init_answer": "The wafer demand across different customer segments in the first quarter of 2023 showed a notable decline, primarily due to customers digesting elevated inventory levels. Wafer shipments fell by 17.5% quarter-over-quarter, and the utilization rate dropped to 70%. Despite this overall decline, the automotive and industrial segments demonstrated growth, with automotive sales accounting for 17% of the total revenue in the first quarter. This indicates that while demand weakened across major end markets, the automotive segment is emerging as a significant revenue contributor and a key growth driver for UMC.\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\n- Total revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was approximately $1.77 billion.\n- Gross profit stood at $628.54 million, with a gross margin of 35.5%.\n- Net income was $529.10 million, reflecting a net income ratio of 0.01.\n\n**Context and Historical Comparison:**\n- Revenue fell 20.1% quarter-over-quarter, indicating a significant decline from the previous quarter, largely due to sluggish wafer demand and unfavorable foreign exchange rates.\n- Despite the decline in shipments and utilization, the gross margin remained firm, reflecting improved structural profitability and an optimized product mix.\n\n**Reasoning for Elevated Inventory Levels:**\n- The elevated inventory levels could be attributed to previous overproduction or a sudden drop in demand, possibly due to market conditions or economic uncertainties that led customers to adjust their procurement strategies.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance:**\n- Entering the second quarter of 2023, UMC expects wafer shipments to remain flat as inventory correction continues amidst overall market softness.\n- The company is focusing on differentiated solutions across larger and specialty technology platforms to secure future business and expand its presence in the IC industry.\n- UMC remains committed to maintaining a high dividend payout while implementing strict cost control measures to ensure profitability through near-term cyclicality.

It seems like from what you're seeing units and shipments, 2Q should be basically flattish or bottoming. But overall, I guess, tone that we're seeing is that demand recovery has been very clear and auto has potentially peaked. And also looking at your utilization rate is actually going to go up, but your capacity is increasing, but unit shipments are flat. So just trying to get a sense of maybe the overall turn versus the guidance. Are there any company-specific issues that -- then we need guys to continue to grow more share or anything that we're missing?\\nChi-Tung Liu: Just base capacity was lower in Q1 because of the new maintenance. And quarter 2, of course, the base went back to normal.",

And quarter 2, of course, the base went back to normal. And on top of that, we have some additional capacity increase. And there's always a wafer ship, wafer out time delayed in a very minimum way. So overall, it's a flattish outlook for second quarter. And yet, we do see some bright spots like our 28 demand is firming up. And the 8-inch outlook seems getting a little bit deteriorated. So there's a mix factors out there on top of the rising raw material costs and the unfavorable following . So all kind of mix up and lead to our current flattish quarter 2 guidance. We are confident for what we have done our company specifically, but for the recovery of the market consensus, we just want to point out that we haven't really seen a very clear signs for a strong recovery as previously, the market was hoping.\\nFrank Lee: Okay. And can I just ask a",

Changing our CapEx will depend on the macro conditions, industry will make a trend and customer long-term business alignment. And like I said, alignment started end of last year on a continued basis, if there is any changes, and then we have to kick in the contingency plan. But at this point, I mean, we -- at this quarter and our CapEx budgets to remain the same.\\nBruce Lu: Yes. One last one is for Chi-Tung. The government also is down well like 30% in first quarter. Is that a new level in coming quarters? And when is the subsidy going to end?\\nChi-Tung Liu: A majority of the subsidy linked to the depreciation schedule of our 12X in Xiamen, and the depreciation for Xiamen has nearly come to a net.
