This demand is primarily driven by applications in 4G and 5G smartphones, solid-state drives, and digital TVs. Financially, the company reported a significant increase in gross profit, surging 54.5% year-over-year to TWD 28.4 billion in the first half of 2021, indicating a strong financial performance that correlates with the growing demand.\n\nThe company's market position is competitive, particularly in the 28-nanometer and 40-nanometer technology nodes, where it continues to enhance its offerings. This strategic focus is crucial as it aligns with industry trends and customer needs, particularly in the high-growth areas of 5G and electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThe increased demand for applications like 4G and 5G smartphones is driven by technological advancements and a shift in consumer behavior towards more connected and smart devices. Solid-state drives and digital TVs are also seeing increased adoption due to their enhanced performance and efficiency.\n\nLooking forward, the company anticipates sustained robust demand, supported by megatrends such as 5G and EVs. However, it also expects supply tightness to persist across 8-inch and 12-inch facilities, which may present challenges in meeting demand. The company plans to continue optimizing its product mix and reducing costs to maintain margin momentum into the third quarter.\n\nOverall, the company's strategic initiatives and market positioning suggest a positive outlook, with expectations of continued growth in wafer demand and financial performance."

However, it mentions that the revenue grew by 13.1% year-over-year for the first six months of 2021. Unfortunately, without the total revenue, precise calculations cannot be made.\n\n2. **Historical Context**:\n   - For historical context, the transcript indicates that revenue from the 28-nanometer technology continues to grow, driven by applications in 4G, 5G smartphones, solid-state drives, and digital TVs. This suggests a positive trend in the technology segment.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**:\n   - The increase in revenue proportions for certain segments can be attributed to strong demand in the communications segment, driven by megatrends such as 5G and electric vehicles (EVs). The company's focus on product optimization and cost reduction also supports these trends.\n\n4. **Future Expectations**:\n   - Looking ahead, the company anticipates robust demand in the third quarter, supported by continuous improvement in blended ASP and sustained structural demand. Supply tightness is expected to persist, particularly in 8-inch and 12-inch facilities, which may continue to impact revenue distribution across segments.\n\nIn summary, while the transcript provides valuable insights into revenue distribution by segment in percentage terms, the absence of the total revenue figure limits the ability to calculate precise sales figures.

Although there is no current sign of an inflection point or down cycle, the company remains prepared to handle such situations if they arise. The risk of a down cycle, while not currently evident, remains a consideration for future sales expectations.\n\nUMC's expectation is that demand will continue to outpace supply in the near term, driven by strong market trends. However, the company is cautious and prepared to adjust its strategies should market conditions shift. While specific future sales targets or growth rates are not provided, the company's alignment with technological advancements and market trends positions it well for continued growth.\n\nIn summary, UMC's future sales expectations are positively influenced by strong demand in emerging technology sectors and strategic operational efficiency.
