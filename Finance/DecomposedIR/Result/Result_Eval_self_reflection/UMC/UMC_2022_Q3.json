This segment accounted for 25% of the overall third-quarter revenue, indicating strong demand and an increase in wafer average selling price. While specific revenue figures for this segment are not provided, the significant contribution to overall revenue underscores its importance.\n\n2. **Automotive Segment**: The automotive segment showed sustained momentum, with healthy inventory levels. The company plans to pursue more collaboration opportunities, reflecting stable demand. Although specific revenue figures for the automotive segment are not provided, the stability suggests consistent performance.\n\n3. **Consumer Segment (PC and Smartphone)**: There is a prolonged inventory correction in the PC and smartphone segments, attributed to factors like market saturation and changes in consumer behavior. This correction indicates a downward trend in demand, expected to persist into the first half of 2023.\n\n4. **Industrial Segment**: Similar to the automotive segment, the industrial segment remains stable with healthy inventory levels. This stability could be due to technological advancements and increased adoption rates in industrial applications.\n\n**Overall Financial Performance**: While specific financial figures such as total revenue or profit for the quarter are not provided in the JSON data, the company has revised its full-year cash-based CapEx from USD 3.6 billion to USD 3 billion for 2022. This adjustment suggests a cautious approach amid the current market conditions.\n\n**Future Expectations**: The company anticipates facing headwinds in the fourth quarter due to demand weakness influenced by the inflationary environment and geopolitical factors like the Ukraine war. Despite these challenges, the company aims to maintain stable operations by closely working with customers to align inventories with market conditions.\n\nIn summary, while the 22/28 nanometer and automotive segments show strong and stable demand, the consumer segment faces challenges due to inventory corrections. The company's cautious financial adjustments and strategic focus on collaborations indicate a proactive approach to navigating these trends."

I think if I go back and look at pricing, blended pricing, especially, in every downturn, we see some degree of price compression. Magnitude is different based on each downturn. But if you look at the last 5, 6 downturns, we’ve already seen price compression on a blended basis. Now this time around, you have been a lot more resilient in your communication about pricing to the market as well as customers. Could you talk a little bit about what is your pricing strategy as we go into the downturn, especially as you mentioned, we still don’t see the trough in terms of where this inventory cycle could drop out? So if your pricing strategy is going to be dependent on how utilization shapes up or you would basically take a pricing strategy such that even if utilization is much weaker because the downturn is longer, pricing is something",

Now we are ready for questions.\\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Randy Abrams, Credit Suisse.\\nRandy Abrams: I wanted to ask the first question just about the -- you’re guiding a somewhat mild or moderate correction in the outlook fourth quarter. Could you discuss if it’s still largely these consumer areas like PC, Android and the digital TV? Or is that extending now if you’re seeing any broadening out to auto industrial networking or also the IDMs, which looked like they had a good quarter in third quarter?\\nJason Wang: Okay. Well, for"

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for the fourth quarter indicate a mild or moderate correction, with a 10% decrease in wafer shipments and a flat average selling price (ASP) in U.S. dollars. The gross profit margin is expected to be in the low 40% range, and the capacity utilization rate is forecasted at 90%. This suggests some resilience in pricing despite the downturn, contrasting with previous downturns where price compression was more pronounced.\n\nHistorically, downturns have varied in magnitude, but the company is maintaining a more stable pricing strategy this time. Unlike previous cycles where pricing was significantly affected, the company appears to be leveraging its strong position in the 28 and 22 technology nodes, driven by robust demand in segments like automotive and OLED drivers. This focus is expected to provide long-term growth opportunities, as these nodes are anticipated to remain relevant due to their application in key areas such as ISP and OLED driver ICs.\n\nIn terms of broader market context, the company is navigating a challenging environment with inventory corrections and lingering demand fluctuations, particularly in consumer areas like PC, Android, and digital TV. Despite these challenges, the company remains confident in its diversified product portfolio and strategic positioning, which are expected to mitigate some of the adverse effects of the downturn.\n\nLooking ahead, the company is likely to continue focusing on strengthening its solutions and customer profile in the 28 and 22 nodes, aiming to capture market opportunities as demand for these technologies grows. While specific revenue and profit figures for Q4 are not provided, the company’s strategic initiatives and stable pricing approach suggest a cautious yet optimistic outlook for future performance."

But from a ASP standpoint, I think there’s a limited trade-off between the loading and pricing. So -- and mainly because the weakness in the sell-through, the end market. If there is no elasticity of the ASP and with the volume and so the benefit will be -- is hard to capture. So that’s why we think the first criteria is we have to understand the end market momentum.

Well, I mean, we -- after the quarter from last quarter, given the rising macro uncertainties and ongoing inventory correction, like I said, in the PC and the smartphone space and as well as the high inflationary cost pressure and we do foresee the semi and foundry industry will decline in 2023 now.

Including projected revenue, profit, or earnings figures would enhance clarity. However, due to the lack of specific data in the transcript, it is essential to note that these figures are not available.\n\n2. **Historical Context and Comparison**:\n   - The semiconductor and foundry industry is anticipated to decline in 2023, following a high growth period in 2022. This context highlights the cyclical nature of the industry and the impact of macroeconomic factors such as inflation and inventory corrections in the PC and smartphone sectors.\n\n3. **Explanations for Trends and Changes**:\n   - The limited elasticity in ASP is due to weak end-market demand, making it challenging to capture benefits from volume changes. This trend contrasts with previous years where demand elasticity might have been more favorable.\n\n4. **Guidance and Strategic Goals**:\n   - UMC plans to bring its 12-inch ASP on stream by mid-2023, with a strategic focus on maintaining or exceeding growth within its addressable market. The company emphasizes its robust demand in segments like OLED driver ICs and the automotive space, particularly for its 28nm and 22nm technology nodes, which are expected to drive long-term growth.\n\n5. **Qualitative and Quantitative Balance**:\n   - While qualitative factors such as market decline and strategic positioning are critical, incorporating any available quantitative metrics, even if speculative, would provide a more balanced view. For instance, discussing potential growth rates or market share targets could offer additional insights into UMC's strategic direction.\n\nIn summary, while specific financial projections for 2023 are not available from the provided context, the focus should be on the strategic initiatives UMC is undertaking to navigate the expected market decline and leverage high-demand segments to drive future growth."
