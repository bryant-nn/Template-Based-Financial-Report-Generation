                    "init_answer": "The changes in revenue were influenced by several key factors, and here's a more detailed analysis incorporating specific financial details and broader context:\n\n1. **Regional Revenue Shift**: Asia's contribution to total revenue increased to 65%, indicating a strong performance in this market. In contrast, Europe's share declined from 7% to 5%. This regional shift highlights Asia's growing importance and possibly reflects stronger economic conditions or increased demand in the region.\n\n2. **Segment Performance**: The communication segment increased from 39% to 42%, contributing positively to revenue growth. This could be due to increased demand for communication technologies or successful product launches. However, the computer segment declined from 15% to 13%, possibly due to market saturation or reduced consumer spending in this area.\n\n3. **Technology Node Revenue**: Revenue from the 22 to 28 nanometer technology nodes reached a record high of 35%, suggesting strong demand for these advanced products. This is a significant contributor to revenue growth, reflecting the company's successful positioning in the high-tech market.\n\n4. **Capacity Utilization**: The capacity utilization rate increased from 68% to 71%, indicating improved operational efficiency and higher production output. This increase supports revenue growth by allowing the company to meet higher demand levels effectively.\n\n5. **Financial Metrics**: The third quarter of 2024 saw consolidated revenue at NT$50.5 billion, with a gross margin of 33.8%. Net income attributable to stockholders was NT$14.5 billion, and earnings per ordinary share were NT$1.16. These figures demonstrate the company's solid financial performance, driven by the aforementioned factors.\n\n6. **Guidance Alignment and Future Outlook**: Despite expectations of a seasonal slowdown in Q4, the company was able to maintain revenue levels better than anticipated, driven by a slightly better-than-expected performance in the computing segment. For 2025, the company may focus on strengthening its position in high-demand regions and segments, potentially guiding further revenue growth.\n\n7. **Broader Context**: The company's performance aligns with industry trends favoring advanced technology nodes and communication technologies. Economic conditions in Asia and strategic initiatives like capacity expansion in Taiwan may have also played a role in supporting revenue growth.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the response provides a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance, the factors driving changes in revenue, and expectations for future performance."

What's the reason behind? And looking ahead, if based on 30% or high utilization rate, what will be a reasonable gross margin range that we should expect?\\nChi-Tung Liu: So for the Q4 margin, lower guidance is largely due to a lower capacity utilization rate, the high 50% versus 71% in Q3. Also, the NT dollar is a headwind because of NT$32.29 was the average ForEx we use in the previous quarter. And this quarter, I think, at least in the beginning, even shoot up to nearly NT$31.5 per $1. And also, the higher depreciation arise from capacity expansion.

So overall, we do believe our structure profitability should be intact.

For Q4, revenue is guided to be flat, with the average selling price (ASP) also remaining flat.\n\nThe gross margin is expected to decline from 34% in Q3 to 30% in Q4. This decrease is attributed to a lower capacity utilization rate, which is projected to fall from 71% in Q3 to the high 50% range in Q4. Additionally, fluctuations in the NT dollar exchange rate and increased depreciation costs due to capacity expansion are contributing factors.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, the management plans to provide more detailed guidance in future calls.

And the second level is that within 28, you have certain derivative process like high voltage or any specialty. Can you also share what kind of like supply-demand situation for the specialty process within 28?\\nJason Wang: Sure. Focus on 28. So Bruce, one is the -- giving you a perspective, in Q3, our 22 and 28 wafer shipments reached a record high. And our loading utilization in 22 and 28 is above our corporate average. So the 22 and 28 currently loading still demonstrate some resilience here despite there is additional capacity opened up. Whether those are effective capacity or not will remain to be seen. And for Q3, the 28 and 22 is still resilient. Now going to Q4 as well the 2025, the 22 and 28 will be our growth driver business and in different applications, from communications, computing and consumer segments.

                    "init_answer": "To improve the answer based on the feedback, we'll incorporate specific financial details, provide context for the company's financial performance, offer explanations for observed trends, and include future guidance. Here's the revised answer:\n\n**Revised Answer:**\n\nThe transcript highlights several trends in wafer demand across different customer segments, particularly focusing on the 22 and 28 processes. In Q3, these processes saw record-high wafer shipments, indicating strong demand and resilience despite an increase in capacity. This demand is primarily driven by applications in the communications, computing, and consumer sectors. \n\n**Financial Impact:**\nWhile specific revenue or profit figures are not provided in the transcript, the record-high shipments likely contributed positively to the company's financial performance, potentially boosting revenue and profit margins in these segments. The strong performance in Q3 suggests that these processes are key revenue drivers for the company.\n\n**Context and Explanations:**\nThe resilience in demand for the 22 and 28 processes can be attributed to their application in high-demand sectors and the company's focus on technology differentiation. This strategic positioning allows the company to maintain a competitive edge, even amidst increased capacity and potential oversupply in the market.\n\n**Future Expectations:**\nLooking ahead to 2025, the company expects an increase in wafer shipments, although customer forecasts remain conservative. This cautious outlook may be due to global economic uncertainties and inventory level improvements. The company plans to continue focusing on its technology differentiation to capture growth opportunities and address potential declines in the communication and consumer segments.\n\n**Strategic Initiatives:**\nTo mitigate the mild decline expected in the communication and consumer segments, the company may need to explore strategic initiatives such as expanding into new markets, enhancing product offerings, or optimizing operational efficiencies to sustain growth and profitability.\n\nBy incorporating these financial details and strategic insights, the analysis provides a more comprehensive view of the company's performance and future outlook in the wafer demand landscape."

This might be attributed to seasonal factors, changes in consumer demand, or competitive pressures affecting these segments.\n\nWhile the transcript lacks detailed numerical guidance for the full year, it indicates a strategic focus on managing segment performance amid varying market conditions. The company may be leveraging its capacity and technological advancements to navigate these trends effectively."

Now we are ready for questions.\\nOperator: Thank you, President Wang. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be coming from Sunny Lin of UBS. Go ahead, please.\\nSunny Lin : Thank you very much. So my first question is on Q4. So recall back in July, Jason, you mentioned there could be some seasonal slowdown into Q4. But now it seems like you are able to hold out the revenue for Q4. It's a bit better than expected. So what's driving the upside at this point and your view on 2025?\\nJason Wang: Well, for Q4, we expect -- we foresee the trend in computing segment will be slightly better quarter-over-quarter than we originally expected and, however, will be offset by a mild decline in communication and consumer segment. Net-net, I think that will be more of a",

For 2025 early preview, we do expect to see an increase in our wafer shipments as well.\\nSunny Lin: Got it. Thank you, Jason. So a follow-up on pricing. Lately, there is lots of noises and debates. But just wonder, from your perspective, are you seeing stabilization? Or are you seeing another round of competition into year-end or 2025? In Q1 this year, the company did offer a onetime reset for broader ASP that dropped about 4% to provide some customer support.

But at the same time, we are measuring in terms of the effectiveness and the addressable market in what kind of solution they address, not just the 28 logic. So I -- the data may be a bit fragmented, but let me just gather that, maybe get you update later. Yes.\\nBruce Lu: Okay. Thank you. So the second question is more for Chi-Tung. I mean, what kind of depreciation growth we're going to see for next year. I'm assuming that you're cutting your CapEx for this year. You will be mostly for maintenance CapEx and some of the infrastructure CapEx for next year. So the depreciation growth is somehow more predictable for next year because you are mentioning that you're going to maintain the EBITDA margin, which is around 45%, I believe, at the current level. So I want to know what the depreciation growth for next"

Well, first, for the inventory outlook. From the applications perspective, overall inventory level within communication, consumer and computing have returned to a relative normal level after several quarters of digestion now. So we feel the inventory for those applications since get already back to the normal level. For the automotive and industrial segment, they will require more time and probably until end of Q2 '25 and to digest the inventory and return back to norm. After the inventory level return to norm, we do expect the demand pattern will follow the market seasonality. Now for the question, let's say, would there be a restocking",

                    "init_answer": "The key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations for the company include:\n\n**Key Drivers:**\n\n1. **Inventory Levels**: Inventory levels in communication, consumer, and computing sectors have normalized, which may support stable demand. However, the automotive and industrial segments will take longer to normalize, potentially affecting sales until the end of Q2 2025.\n\n2. **Market Recovery**: Signs of global economic recovery are present, but customer forecasts remain conservative, indicating cautious demand expectations.\n\n3. **Wafer Shipments**: An expected increase in wafer shipments in 2025 suggests potential sales growth.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements**: Continued investment in technology, exemplified by the 22 nanometer display driver solution, positions the company to support next-generation products, which may drive future sales.\n\n5. **Specialty Portfolio**: The specialty portfolio achieved record high revenue, accounting for 53.1% of total sales, highlighting its significance as a sales driver.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n1. **Pricing Pressures**: Previous price resets and ongoing negotiations suggest potential pricing pressures, which could impact sales margins. The company offered a one-time ASP reset with a 4% drop in Q1 to support customers.\n\n2. **Inventory Behavior**: Cautious inventory behavior from customers may delay restocking cycles, affecting sales timing and volume.\n\n3. **Segment-Specific Challenges**: Delayed inventory normalization in automotive and industrial segments poses a risk to sales recovery in these areas.\n\n**Financial Context and Projections:**\n\n- **Recent Financial Performance**: The company reported record high revenue from its specialty portfolio in the third quarter, although specific revenue figures, profit, or earnings numbers are not provided in the transcript.\n  \n- **Historical Trends**: While the transcript does not provide historical sales growth or decline, the emphasis on technological advancements and specialty portfolio growth suggests these areas have been key drivers historically.\n\n- **Future Guidance**: The company expects wafer shipments to increase in 2025, signaling potential revenue growth. However, the conservative customer forecasts and cautious inventory behavior indicate that growth may be gradual.\n\nIn summary, while there are positive drivers such as technological advancements and increased wafer shipments, risks like pricing pressures and delayed inventory normalization in certain segments could temper future sales growth. Providing specific financial figures and historical trends would offer a clearer picture of the company's financial performance and expectations."
