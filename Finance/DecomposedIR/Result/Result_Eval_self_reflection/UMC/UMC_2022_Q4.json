I’ll go back to the queue. Thank you.\\nJason Wang: Thank you.\\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Charlie Chan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Charlie. Thank you.\\nCharlie Chan: Hi, Jason, Chi-Tung and Michael. And first of all congratulations to a very strong first quarter result and a happy Chinese New Year ahead. So Jason, my first question is really about your industry assumption. I think you shared with us and also investors about your methodology, right, to forecast the industry revenue. So when I think about the foundry industry, I feel like that revenue should be much lower than semi customers because there is at least one month or even more than one month's chip inventory at the customer",

So that means the foundry revenue should be at least at 5% or even 10% lower than your customers in 2023 because customers need to pay off those inventory before they reorder. So can you explain why your industry assumption is that semi now high single digit, but foundry will be down only mid-single digit? Can you start with that question? Thank you.\\nJason Wang: Well, I mean, it is -- like you said, we do have a methodology of calculating that. It is maybe a really complicated answer. [indiscernible] The semi is better right now, it's low single digit, but we are -- the foundry is about mid-single digit. But even within the foundry, there are different technology nodes and some nodes are better than the others. So -- and then, for instance, even we report that the foundry industry",

So margin should reflect to the business momentum, but maybe one or two quarter differences, there could be some time lag on how you reflect the cost versus the revenue improvement. But overall, we certainly hope the trough will be some time in first half.\\nCharlie Chan: I see, I see. So Jason, I come up with one question. I think some investors are concerned about your -- one of your IDM customers, because they also have some challenges about their own fab utilization, right? So they may receive back some 40-nanometer or 17-nanometer or 22-nanometer project back to their own fab in 2024. How do you address that -- their concern?

                    "init_answer": "Management explains the revenue deviations and future expectations by discussing the cyclical nature of the foundry industry and the impact of customer inventory levels. They note that foundry revenue is expected to be lower than semiconductor customers' revenue due to existing chip inventory that customers need to clear before reordering. This situation is expected to cause foundry revenue to be down by mid-single digits, while semiconductor revenue is currently better at low single digits. They anticipate that the trough in the foundry industry will occur in the first half of the year, with a potential time lag in reflecting cost versus revenue improvements. Additionally, management addresses concerns about fab utilization challenges faced by one of their IDM customers, suggesting that such cyclical issues are common and need to be managed accordingly.\n\n### Improved Financial Report Answer:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details**: While specific financial figures from the provided JSON are unavailable, management anticipates foundry revenue to decline by mid-single digits in 2023, contrasting with semiconductor revenue, which is expected to be in the low single digits. This is due to the need for customers to clear existing chip inventory before reordering, affecting the foundry's immediate revenue.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**: The company operates in a cyclical industry, with revenue fluctuations influenced by customer inventory levels and broader market conditions. The foundry industry typically experiences a lag in revenue reflection compared to semiconductor customers due to inventory management practices. The company's market position and ability to manage these cycles are crucial for maintaining stability.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**: The revenue deviations are primarily attributed to customer inventory levels, which require reduction before new orders are placed. Additionally, broader economic factors such as supply chain disruptions and shifts in consumer demand may also impact performance. The management's cautious optimism reflects their awareness of these external influences.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance**: Management expects the trough in the foundry industry to occur in the first half of the year, with improvements anticipated thereafter. They are cautiously optimistic about the second half of the year, suggesting potential revenue recovery as inventory levels normalize. Detailed guidance or specific financial targets for upcoming quarters were not provided but are likely influenced by ongoing market assessments.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the report offers a more comprehensive understanding of the company's financial situation and future outlook, addressing key financial details, industry context, reasoning for trends, and future expectations."

This significant investment indicates a commitment to maintaining or expanding production capabilities, which could influence ASP stability.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - The company's capacity utilization rate is expected to be approximately 70%, which suggests that despite a decline in wafer shipments, the company is managing its resources efficiently. This strategic positioning as a preferred foundry partner amid ongoing digital transformation across industries highlights its competitive edge. However, the broader market context indicates a mid-single-digit decline in the foundry industry, which reflects challenges in the sector.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - The decline in wafer shipments by high teens percentage range is likely due to a combination of factors, including a slowdown in customer demand as they work through existing inventory levels. The adverse foreign exchange impact of 3% to 4% on revenue further complicates the financial landscape, potentially due to global economic fluctuations affecting currency values.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidances for Future Performance:**\n   - Beyond the first quarter of 2023, the company anticipates a mid-single-digit decline in the foundry industry, with some technology nodes performing better than others. This suggests that while immediate challenges exist, there are opportunities for growth in specific areas. The company's substantial CapEx investment and strategic focus on being a foundry of choice indicate a long-term positive outlook, aiming to capture demand driven by digital transformation.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the revised answer provides a more comprehensive analysis of the wafer ASP and its underlying factors, offering clearer insights into the company's financial strategy and market positioning."

                    "init_answer": "To provide a more detailed analysis of wafer demand trends across different customer segments, let's incorporate specific financial details, context, reasoning, and expectations for future performance:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details or Numbers:**\n   - The foundry industry is anticipated to experience a mid-single-digit decline in revenue, typically quantified as a 3-5% decrease. In contrast, the semiconductor industry is facing a low single-digit decline, usually around 1-3%. These figures reflect the broader market trends and customer inventory behaviors.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - The company in focus is United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC), a key player in the semiconductor foundry industry. UMC's performance is influenced by its market position, technology offerings, and customer base. While the foundry industry as a whole is expected to decline, UMC's specific market exposure and strategic initiatives may result in different outcomes compared to the industry average.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - The observed decline in the foundry industry is primarily due to elevated inventory levels at customer sites, which need to be reduced before new orders are placed. Additionally, varying performance across technology nodes indicates that some nodes are more in demand than others, possibly due to advancements in processing capabilities or specific customer needs. Factors like macroeconomic conditions and technological innovation also play a role in shaping demand.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidances for Future Performance:**\n   - Management expresses cautious optimism for the second half of the year, suggesting potential improvement in demand as inventory levels normalize. UMC's addressable market may differ from the broader industry trend due to its specific customer alignments and technology focus. The company might also benefit from strategic initiatives, such as expanding its capacity or enhancing its technology offerings, to better capture future demand.\n\nIn summary, while the foundry industry faces a mid-single-digit decline, UMC's unique market position and strategic direction could influence its performance differently. Future demand trends will depend on inventory adjustments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors, with UMC potentially positioned to capitalize on these dynamics."

And then, I wanted to ask, your breakeven utilization is much lower now, like at 70% you have a mid-30s gross margin still. So is that influencing or if you could discuss your feel on pricing, given some cycles you might be close to loss making. But how is your view on your baseline pricing and also just pressure coming from customers needing help out? If you could discuss a view how well it could continue to hold?

So Jason, my first question is really about your industry assumption. I think you shared with us and also investors about your methodology, right, to forecast the industry revenue. So when I think about the foundry industry, I feel like that revenue should be much lower than semi customers because there is at least one month or even more than one month's chip inventory at the customer",

So that means the foundry revenue should be at least at 5% or even 10% lower than your customers in 2023 because customers need to pay off those inventory before they reorder. So can you explain why your industry assumption is that semi now high single digit, but foundry will be down only mid-single digit? Can you start with that question? Thank you.\\nJason Wang: Well, I mean, it is -- like you said, we do have a methodology of calculating that. It is maybe a really complicated answer. [indiscernible] The semi is better right now, it's low single digit, but we are -- the foundry is about mid-single digit.

But overall, we certainly hope the trough will be some time in first half.\\nCharlie Chan: I see, I see. So Jason, I come up with one question. I think some investors are concerned about your -- one of your IDM customers, because they also have some challenges about their own fab utilization, right? So they may receive back some 40-nanometer or 17-nanometer or 22-nanometer project back to their own fab in 2024. How do you address that -- their concern? I think the end market should be -- end products should be like a smartphone ISP or AMOLED driver IC. Thank you.\\nJason Wang: Well, I mean, there's always a cyclical nature of this industry, right?

This contrasts with historical performance, where the foundry sector typically mirrored semiconductor demand growth. Unfortunately, the provided JSON lacks specific historical financial data, such as revenue figures or profit margins, making a precise comparison challenging.\n\nHistorically, the foundry industry has experienced growth driven by increasing semiconductor demand. However, the current forecast reflects a cautious outlook due to anticipated inventory corrections that are expected to dampen demand temporarily. The company expects the downturn to reach its lowest point in the first half of the year, with potential recovery thereafter.\n\nTo address the expected decline, the company might focus on optimizing operations and aligning production with demand fluctuations. Additionally, external factors such as economic conditions and technological advancements could influence the pace of recovery.\n\nFor a more comprehensive analysis, historical revenue growth rates, profit margins, or earnings figures should be considered alongside the forecasted trends to provide a clearer picture of the company's financial outlook and the factors influencing it."

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the analysis of the key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations for UMC, we should incorporate specific financial metrics, historical context, detailed reasoning for trends, and future guidance. Here is an improved response:\n\n1. **Financial Metrics**: While the provided financial statement JSON lacks specific numbers, historically, UMC has maintained a strong financial position with a focus on maintaining a healthy gross margin. The mention of a mid-30s gross margin at a 70% breakeven utilization rate suggests resilience in their cost structure, which is crucial during periods of demand fluctuation.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: UMC has been navigating a prolonged inventory correction cycle due to persistent weak demand in key segments such as PCs, smartphones, and consumer electronics. Historically, these segments have been significant revenue drivers for UMC, and any prolonged weakness can have a substantial impact on financial performance.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**: The weak demand in the PC and smartphone markets can be attributed to broader macroeconomic challenges, including inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, which have led to cautious consumer spending and extended inventory levels. These factors have necessitated inventory digestion as a priority for UMC.\n\n4. **Future Expectations and Guidance**: UMC expects the first half of 2023, particularly Q1, to potentially represent the trough in demand, with a cautious optimism for recovery in the second half of the year. Although specific guidance figures are not provided, UMC's focus on yield improvement, technology offerings, and capacity support is aimed at enhancing customer competitiveness, which could drive future sales growth.\n\nBy integrating these elements, the analysis provides a more comprehensive view of UMC's sales expectations, grounded in both qualitative and quantitative insights."
