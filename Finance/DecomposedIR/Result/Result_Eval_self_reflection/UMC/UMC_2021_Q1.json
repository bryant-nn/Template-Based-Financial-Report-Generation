The company reported a revenue of TWD 47.1 billion, representing a 4% quarter-over-quarter growth. This increase was attributed to a more than 3% rise in average selling price (ASP) and a similar increase in wafer shipments. These factors were somewhat offset by the impact of a stronger New Taiwan dollar, which had a nearly 2% negative effect on revenue due to foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe revenue growth aligns with previous guidance, as the company anticipated ASP growth and capacity growth of around 3% to 5% for the year, which was consistent with the actual performance in Q1. The increase in ASP and wafer shipments can be linked to heightened demand and favorable product mix improvements.\n\nIn terms of broader financial context, the company's gross profit margin improved to 26.5%, up from 19.2% in the same period last year, indicating enhanced operational efficiency and cost management. Operating income margin also saw a substantial increase from 8.1% in Q1 2020 to 16.2% in Q1 2021.\n\nLooking forward, the company expects similar driving forces to contribute to revenue growth in the upcoming quarters, with ASP and product mix improvements continuing to play significant roles. The company maintains its capacity growth outlook of 3% to 5% for the year, indicating steady expansion plans. These strategic initiatives are expected to support sustained revenue growth and align with the company's long-term financial objectives."

This stability is due to effective management of production capabilities and alignment with market needs.\n\n3. **Profitability and Gross Margin**: The P6 project is expected to be profitable from its inception and will not dilute the gross margin. Instead, it is anticipated to enhance the overall Return on Equity (ROE) performance, driven by efficient cost management and strategic project execution.\n\n4. **Wafer Supply and Pricing**: Management has successfully secured an adequate supply of raw wafers, ensuring no disruptions in production. Although they acknowledge pricing dynamics in the wafer market, they remain confident in managing these fluctuations without impacting profitability.\n\n5. **Historical Context and Financial Performance**: While specific financial figures such as total revenue or profit are not provided, the company has historically managed to maintain a downward depreciation trend, with less than a 5% annual decline in depreciation expenses, indicating prudent asset management.\n\n6. **Future Expectations**: Looking ahead, the management is optimistic about maintaining profitability and managing costs effectively.

However, despite this shift, there is no significant overflow from 8-inch to 12-inch wafers due to sustained high demand for 8-inch wafers.\n\n**Key Financial Details or Numbers**: Unfortunately, the provided financial statements lack specific figures related to wafer sales, revenue, or profit, making it challenging to quantify the financial impact of this trend. Therefore, it is crucial to obtain detailed financial data to assess revenue changes associated with 8-inch and 12-inch wafers.\n\n**Context for the Company's Financial Performance**: The financial statements do not provide specific figures for revenue, net income, or other key metrics. However, the company's strategic alignment with customers and focus on high-growth areas suggest a positive outlook for future financial performance, especially as they secure P6 capacity for future growth.\n\n**Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes**: The shift from 8-inch to 12-inch wafers is primarily attributed to performance enhancements and cost efficiencies. While specific data is unavailable, these factors generally lead to improved production yields and lower manufacturing costs, enhancing overall competitiveness.\n\n**Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance**: The company is strategically positioning itself by aligning with customer needs on a per-application basis and securing necessary capacity for future growth. Although specific guidance on future wafer demand or financial performance is not provided, the company's proactive approach indicates readiness to capitalize on these trends.\n\nTo better understand the financial implications, obtaining specific revenue and profit figures related to wafer sales and any forward-looking statements from the company would be beneficial."

However, we can glean some insights from the available information:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details or Numbers:**\n   - The transcript indicates a 4% quarter-over-quarter growth in revenue for Q1, driven by a 3%-plus increase in average selling price (ASP) and wafer shipment. The gross profit margin improved to 26.5%, with an operating income margin of 16.2%. The net income per ADS was TWD 0.85, approximately USD 0.149.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - Year-over-year, the company experienced an 11.4% increase in revenue despite a stronger NT dollar. The gross margin improved by nearly 7 percentage points from 19.2% in Q1 2020 to 26.5% in Q1 2021. The operating margin also improved from 8.1% in Q1 2020 to 16.2% in Q1 2021.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - The growth in ASP is attributed to price increases and product mix improvements, each contributing nearly equally. The negative impact from foreign exchange was nearly 2%.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidances for Future Performance:**\n   - The company expects a similar 4% growth in ASP for the second quarter, driven by continued product mix improvements and price increases. Capacity growth for the year is anticipated to be in the range of 3% to 5%.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive analysis, specific revenue, profit, or earnings figures for each segment would be necessary. Additionally, more detailed explanations of product mix changes and strategic plans for each segment would enhance the understanding of future performance expectations."

I think you did talk about blended ASP being up maybe about 10% this year compared to previous. I think we're expecting a little bit more, like mid-single digits. Shipment growth or capacity growth outlook for this year, are we still roughly looking at 3% to 5% capacity growth this year? Or is it a little bit better now?\\nJason Wang: Yeah. That capacity growth is the same for the year, yes.\\nGokul Hariharan: Understood. Thank you very much. I’ll go back to the queue.\\nJason Wang: All right.

For sequential comparison, Q1 revenue of TWD 47.1 billion represents about 4% quarter-over-quarter growth, which contributed both from ASP increase of 3%-plus as well as wafer shipment, which is also 3%-plus. And it was somewhat offseted by the stronger NT dollars. Gross profit margin continued to grow to 26.5% or TWD 12.5 billion. And operating income margin rate in first quarter was 16.2%, increased by 35.7% sequentially. So the net income as reported was around TWD 0.85 per -- for -- per ADS is about US$0.149.

The company expects a 3% to 5% capacity growth and a 4% ASP (Average Selling Price) growth in the upcoming quarter. Historically, the company reported a Q1 revenue of TWD 47.1 billion, reflecting an 11.4% year-over-year growth despite a stronger NT dollar impacting revenue. Gross margin improved significantly from 19.2% to 26.5%, and operating margin increased from 8.1% to 16.2% year-over-year. These improvements were primarily driven by a combination of price increases and product mix enhancements.\n\nIn terms of market conditions, the semiconductor industry has been experiencing robust demand, which has allowed the company to implement price increases and optimize its product mix. The strategic focus on ramping up production capacity while enhancing product offerings has been instrumental in driving these financial improvements.\n\nLooking forward, the company maintains a positive outlook, with expectations of similar driving forces contributing to ASP growth in the next quarter. The company plans to continue leveraging its strategic initiatives, such as optimizing production processes and focusing on high-demand product segments, to sustain its growth momentum. However, specific guidance figures or detailed strategic plans for achieving this growth have not been disclosed in the transcript."

And is there an initial view how 2022 if you're already contracting out and may see some movement up on pricing into next year?\\nJason Wang: We will continue aligning with our customers. From the recent market dynamics, our forecast for the full year ASP growth will be in the high single digit year-over-year now. And it could approach 10%. And the 10% of the pricing will also include our product mix improvement. And -- therefore, the current ASP lift mainly reflect the value of overall market position, but is more aligned to the market price and market position.
