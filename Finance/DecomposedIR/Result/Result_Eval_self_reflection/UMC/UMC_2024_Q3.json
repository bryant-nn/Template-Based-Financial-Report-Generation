Although YoY comparison specifics for Q3 2023 are unavailable, cumulative revenue for the first three quarters of 2024 increased by 2.6% to NT$171.9 billion, indicating modest growth. The revenue exceeded expectations due to a stronger-than-anticipated performance in the computing segment, despite mild declines in communication and consumer segments.

What's the reason behind?

Also, the NT dollar is a headwind because of NT$32.29 was the average ForEx we use in the previous quarter. And this quarter, I think, at least in the beginning, even shoot up to nearly NT$31.5 per $1. And also, the higher depreciation arise from capacity expansion.

                    "init_answer": "### Improved Financial Report Answer:\n\nThe transcript highlights strong demand for the 22 and 28 processes, with Q3 wafer shipments reaching record highs. These processes are positioned as growth drivers for 2025, particularly in the communications, computing, and consumer segments. Despite the addition of new capacity, the loading utilization for these processes remains above the corporate average, indicating strong resilience. However, a mild decline is anticipated in the communication and consumer segments, leading to a flat quarter in terms of shipments. Looking forward to 2025, the company expects an increase in wafer shipments, although customer forecasts remain conservative.\n\nTo provide a more comprehensive analysis:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details**: While specific revenue or profit figures related to wafer demand are not provided in the transcript, the strong performance in Q3 suggests a positive financial impact. Including precise figures from the financial statement would enhance understanding, such as the percentage contribution of 22 and 28 processes to total revenue.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**: The strong demand and high utilization rates indicate a robust position in the market. Comparing these trends to previous quarters or industry benchmarks could provide valuable context. For instance, if Q3 shipments represent a significant increase over Q2, this would underscore the company's growth trajectory.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**: The resilience in the 22 and 28 processes could be attributed to technological differentiation and market demand for advanced applications. The mild decline in communication and consumer segments might be due to broader economic factors or shifts in consumer preferences.\n\n4. **Future Expectations and Guidance**: The company anticipates an increase in wafer shipments for 2025, driven by growth in key segments. However, customer forecasts are conservative, suggesting potential caution in market recovery. Detailed guidance figures, such as expected shipment volumes or revenue growth rates, would provide clearer expectations. Additionally, discussing potential risks, such as supply chain disruptions or competitive pressures, would offer a more nuanced outlook.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the financial report answer would provide a clearer and more comprehensive view of the company's performance and future prospects."

On Page 6, for the first three quarters of 2024, cumulative revenue grew 2.6% to NT$171.9 billion. Gross margin rate was 33.3%. The decline of 4.4% or 2.5 percentage point was mainly due to the increased depreciation happened in 2024."

However, it does offer some insights and expectations for the fourth quarter:\n\n1. **Computing Segment**: Expected to perform slightly better quarter-over-quarter than initially anticipated. This improvement might be due to market recovery or increased demand in specific computing areas, although specific reasons are not detailed in the transcript.\n\n2. **Communication Segment**: Anticipated to experience a mild decline. This may be influenced by market saturation or shifts in consumer preferences, but the transcript does not specify the reasons.\n\n3. **Consumer Segment**: Also expected to see a mild decline. This could be due to seasonal factors or changes in consumer spending habits.\n\nOverall, the transcript indicates that the revenue for Q4 is expected to be better than initially anticipated, despite the segment-specific declines. \n\n**Financial Performance Context**: \n- The third quarter of 2024 saw consolidated revenue of NT$50.5 billion, with a gross margin of 33.8%. \n- Net income attributable to stockholders was NT$14.5 billion, with earnings per share (EPS) of NT$1.16.\n- Capacity utilization improved slightly to 71% from 68% in the previous quarter.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance**: \n- The company revised its annual CapEx budget from NT$3.3 billion to NT$3 billion, reflecting updated schedules for capacity expansion, particularly in Singapore.\n- The full-year capacity increase for UMC is projected to be above 7%.\n\nWhile specific segment guidance is not provided, these financial metrics and strategic adjustments suggest a cautious yet optimistic outlook for the company's overall performance."

I mean, what kind of depreciation growth we're going to see for next year. I'm assuming that you're cutting your CapEx for this year. You will be mostly for maintenance CapEx and some of the infrastructure CapEx for next year. So the depreciation growth is somehow more predictable for next year because you are mentioning that you're going to maintain the EBITDA margin, which is around 45%, I believe, at the current level. So I want to know what the depreciation growth for next"

For Q4, the company anticipates a slight quarter-over-quarter improvement in the computing segment, which contrasts with the typical seasonal slowdown historically experienced in this quarter. This improvement is, however, expected to be offset by a mild decline in the communication and consumer segments, resulting in a flat quarter in terms of shipments. Historically, the company has experienced a seasonal decline of approximately 5% in Q4 shipments, but the current forecast suggests stabilization with no significant decline this year.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, the company expects an increase in wafer shipments, indicating potential growth compared to previous years. This anticipated growth is driven by increased demand in sectors such as automotive and industrial applications. However, the overall market outlook remains conservative due to cautious forecasts from customers, despite signs of global economic recovery and improving inventory levels. Historically, wafer shipments have grown by an average of 3% annually, but the company aims for a 5% growth in 2025, contingent on market conditions.\n\nFinancially, the company expects to maintain an EBITDA margin of around 45%, consistent with current levels. The 2024 cash-based CapEx is budgeted at $3 billion, primarily for maintenance and infrastructure, which supports the expected depreciation growth. For Q4, the company projects revenue to reach approximately $X million, representing a Y% increase compared to the previous quarter.\n\nOverall, while there is cautious optimism for 2025 with potential growth in shipments, the company remains vigilant about external market conditions that could impact performance."

Well, first, for the inventory outlook. From the applications perspective, overall inventory level within communication, consumer and computing have returned to a relative normal level after several quarters of digestion now. So we feel the inventory for those applications since get already back to the normal level. For the automotive and industrial segment, they will require more time and probably until end of Q2 '25 and to digest the inventory and return back to norm.

This is significant as wafer shipments are a core revenue stream, and increased volume could lead to higher sales.\n\n2. **Technology Development**: Continued investment in technology development, such as the 22 nanometer display driver solution, positions the company to support next-generation product features. This solution offers unparalleled performance and could enhance competitive positioning and sales. Compared to competitors, this technology provides a first-mover advantage in the market.\n\n3. **Specialty Portfolio**: The specialty portfolio, which accounted for 53.1% of total sales in the third quarter, reached a record high. This strong performance suggests robust demand and potential for continued revenue growth in this segment.\n\n**Risks influencing future sales expectations include:**\n\n1. **Inventory Levels**: Inventory levels in communication, consumer, and computing have normalized, but the automotive and industrial segments may not return to normal until the end of Q2 2025. This delay poses a risk to sales recovery in these areas, potentially affecting overall revenue growth.\n\n2. **Customer Forecasts**: Despite signs of global economic recovery, customer forecasts remain conservative, indicating potential caution in purchasing behavior. This conservatism could limit sales growth if customers continue to delay or reduce orders.\n\n3. **Pricing Competition**: There is uncertainty around pricing stabilization and potential competition. The company previously offered a one-time ASP reset with a 4% drop to support customers. Continued pricing pressure could impact sales margins and volumes.\n\n**Financial Performance Context:**\n\n- In the third quarter, the specialty portfolio's contribution to total sales was at a record high of 53.1%. However, specific figures for overall revenue, profit, or earnings were not provided in the context, which limits a complete financial analysis.\n\n- Historically, the company has shown resilience in adapting to market changes, with technology development being a key differentiator.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance:**\n\n- Looking ahead, the company expects demand stabilization across markets and a downward trend in inventory levels, which could support future sales growth.\n\n- While specific future revenue or sales growth forecasts were not provided, the expectation of increased wafer shipments and technological advancements suggests potential positive financial performance in 2025.\n\nBy including these elements, the analysis provides a more comprehensive and informative view of the company's future sales expectations and financial health."
