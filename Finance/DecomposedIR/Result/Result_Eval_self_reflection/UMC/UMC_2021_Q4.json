The company's total revenue for 2021 grew by 20.5% in NT dollar terms to NT$213 billion, and by approximately 26-27% in US dollar terms due to the appreciation of the NT dollar against the US dollar.\n\nKey factors contributing to this growth include:\n\n1. **Segment Contributions:**\n   - IDM revenue increased by 3 percentage points, accounting for 15% of total revenue in 2021 compared to 12% in 2020.\n   - The communication segment remained stable, contributing 46% of total revenue.\n   - The computer and consumer segments each grew by 3 percentage points, reaching 17% and 27% of total revenue, respectively.\n\n2. **Technology Advancements:**\n   - Revenue from the 22/28-nanometer technology increased significantly, from 14% in the previous year to 20% in 2021. This shift contributed to an improved blended average selling price (ASP).\n\n3. **Market and Strategic Factors:**\n   - The company benefited from a stronger stock market performance, which positively impacted net non-operating income, growing it by 70% year-over-year.\n   - The stronger NT dollar against the US dollar further enhanced revenue growth in US dollar terms.\n\n4. **Expense Management:**\n   - Operating expenses were effectively controlled, contributing to a higher gross profit margin of 33.8% or NT$72 billion for the year.\n\n**Future Expectations:**\nThe company has indicated continued mild capacity expansion and expects the ASP trend to continue inching up. However, specific guidance for the next fiscal year was not detailed in the transcript. The strategic focus on technology advancements and segment contributions is likely to support sustained growth.\n\nIn summary, the combination of strategic segment growth, technology improvements, effective expense management, and favorable currency exchange rates aligned well with the company's guidance and contributed to the robust financial performance in 2021."

This increase was significantly driven by a 75% year-over-year revenue surge in 28-nanometer technologies, reflecting robust chip demand related to 5G, AIoT, and automotive megatrends. For the full year 2021, UMC's revenue rose by more than 20% year-over-year, with operating income reaching a record high, showcasing the company's strong market position and ability to capitalize on industry trends.\n\nDespite the ASP increase, the gross margin only improved by 1% due to increased non-depreciation costs. These costs were primarily attributed to structural increases in labor and raw material expenses, driven by supply chain pressures and broader structural changes in the industry.\n\nLooking ahead, UMC anticipates continued strong demand across all nodes in its addressable market, supported by industry trends. The company aims to maintain a balanced ASP strategy that reflects its value and market price, while also strengthening long-term customer relationships. Management expects the demand to outpace supply, which could support future growth, although ongoing cost pressures remain a consideration."

The demand associated with work-from-home and home learning segments, as well as in the lower-end smartphone segment, is experiencing some softness. However, the demand for 5G smartphones is expected to continue growing. The automotive and IoT (Internet of Things) sectors are experiencing robust demand, likely offsetting the softness in other areas. Overall, the demand is anticipated to remain robust, driven by the 75% year-over-year revenue increase from 28-nanometer technologies, which is significantly contributing to the company's revenue growth and financial structure improvement.\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\n- Wafer shipments grew 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to 2.55 million 8-inch equivalents in Q4 2021.\n- Revenue in 2021 rose by more than 20% year-over-year.\n- A 75% year-over-year revenue increase from 28-nanometer technologies.\n\n**Financial Performance Context:**\nUMC's financial performance is strong, with a record high in operating income driven by the surge in its 28-nanometer business. The company's healthy 28-nanometer product pipeline is expected to further diversify its product portfolio and customer base, enabling UMC to capture additional market share.\n\n**Reasoning for Trends:**\n- Softness in work-from-home and home learning segments may be due to the easing of pandemic restrictions and a return to normalcy.\n- The robust demand in the automotive and IoT sectors is driven by ongoing technological advancements and the increasing integration of chips in these industries.\n\n**Future Expectations:**\nLooking ahead into Q1 2022, UMC anticipates that demand across all nodes in its addressable market will continue to outpace supply, supporting long-term growth.

So for page 10, fourth quarter identical that IDM contribute around 14% of the total revenue. And for the full year, we see a 3% - percentage point increase for IDM revenue to 15% in 2021 versus 12% in 2020. So on page 12, communication also remain around 46% of the pie.

And for Q4 of '21 by technology breakdown on page 14, for 22/28-nanometer, that account for about 20% of our total revenue, with 38% of the revenue coming from 40-nano and below in Q4. And for the full year, on page 15, we see a pretty meaningful increase in 22/28 revenue from 14% in the previous year to 20% in 2021, which also helped our blended ASP.

So can you break down into smartphone versus non-smartphone in that communications segment?\\nJason Wang: You mean within the communications segment?\\nCharlie Chan: Yes. How much is the smartphone?\\nJason Wang: Oh, for the wireless, we project it's going to be about 85%. And for the wire, wire is probably going to be about 15%.\\nCharlie Chan: Oh, okay. I see. Yeah. So I think I wanted to ask this. It's really to allude to this kind of tech supply chain inventory debate. So I guess first, I suppose it's just very, very near term, right, since you have a exposure to smartphone as well. Do you see any kind of a slowdown or inventory increase at your customers or channel for any of the segments, not just smartphone but also other consumer tech, PC, et cetera?

According to our calculation, it should be more than 10% last year and should be close to 10% in 2022. Just want to compare notes with your assumption.\\nJason Wang: Well, I mean, the - we - obviously, we have a - some data internally, the intelligence. But the data may base on a different base. So - and different numbers. So it's - I don't want to mislead you. It's associated with a different base level and different end result.

Do you think the - is it similar to your company's trend, meaning the ASP increase account for maybe 15% of growth and shipment increases 5%?\\nJason Wang: Well, I mean, the - our previous outlook based on the market data is we believe the foundry growth will be about 12% this year. And now we revised to about 20% and largely due to a higher utilization, some of the capacity expansion and also the ASP increase around the industry. So they're a combination, in our view, and that led us to believe that 20% will be the current projection.\\nCharlie Chan: Okay, understood.
