The sequential growth was driven by a better product mix, improved blended ASPs, and favorable exchange rates, aligning with previous guidance. The year-over-year decline was attributed to a challenging market environment and reduced consumer demand. Despite the downturn, UMC maintained a stable gross margin of 35.9% through strategic capacity expansions, particularly in the Thailand P6 facility. Looking ahead, UMC expects over 2% sequential capacity growth in Q4 2023 and continues to focus on product mix optimization and strategic investments to support future performance.",

However, year-over-year, the revenue experienced a decline of approximately 20.5%, as the revenue for the first nine months of 2023 was NT$167.5 billion, indicating a downturn in the business cycle.\n\n**Key Financial Metrics**:\n- **Gross Profit**: NT$20.4 billion with a gross margin of 35.9%, slightly lower than the previous year's 45.8%.\n- **Operating Income**: NT$15.96 billion, contributing to an EPS of NT$1.29 for Q3.\n- **Net Income**: NT$494.7 million, with a net income ratio of 0.009.\n- **EBITDA**: NT$780.3 million, reflecting an EBITDA ratio of 0.015.\n\n**Context for Financial Performance**:\nThe revenue decline is attributed to a challenging market environment and a downturn in the business cycle. The company has faced a reduction in consumer demand, evidenced by a drop in the consumer segment from 26% in Q2 to 23% in Q3. Despite these challenges, the company has managed to maintain a stable gross margin due to a better product mix and favorable exchange rates.\n\n**Explanations for Trends**:\nThe sequential revenue growth of 1.4% was driven by an improved product mix and better blended ASPs. The company benefited from increased capacity, particularly in their Thailand P6 facility, which contributed to a slight increase in capacity utilization to 67%.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance**:\nUMC expects more than a 2% sequential capacity growth in Q4 2023, primarily from the expansion in their Thailand facility. The company maintains its CapEx budget at approximately $3 billion for 2023, indicating a focus on strategic investments to enhance production capabilities and support future growth.\n\nOverall, while UMC faces market challenges, its strategic capacity expansions and focus on product mix optimization are expected to support its performance in the coming quarters."

However, we can infer some insights based on the available data:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth and Technology Contribution:**\n   - The revenue for technologies at 49 nanometers and below increased to 45% in Q3 2023, up from 41% in the previous quarter. This suggests a higher demand for these advanced technologies, which likely contributed to an increase in wafer sales volume.\n\n2. **Capacity Expansion:**\n   - The transcript mentions a more than 1% capacity increase in Q3 2023, with expectations for over a 2% increase in Q4 2023. This capacity expansion, primarily at the Thailand P6 facility, indicates the company's ability to produce and potentially sell more wafers.\n\n3. **Financial Performance:**\n   - UMC's total revenue for Q3 2023 was $1,767,879,362. Given the increase in revenue contribution from advanced technologies, it's reasonable to assume that wafer sales volume has grown in line with this revenue increase.\n\n4. **Market Conditions and Future Expectations:**\n   - The company maintains solid structural profitability despite a significant decline in market demand for the foundry industry. UMC's focus on product mix optimization and specialty technologies supports its competitive position.\n   - For Q4 2023, demand is expected to stabilize, although customers remain cautious with inventory levels. This suggests a potential leveling off in wafer sales volume growth, despite the capacity increases.\n\nIn summary, while specific wafer sales volume figures for Q3 2023 are not provided, the increase in revenue from advanced technologies and capacity expansion indicates a positive trend in sales volume compared to previous periods. Looking ahead, capacity growth and market stabilization may continue to support wafer sales, albeit with some caution due to market conditions."

Do you -- I don't think you report your revenue exposure to the industrial segment, but do you see similar trend in industrial?\\nJason Wang: It's similar, but it is actually better than automotive right now. They both automotive and industrial is covered under the others. But the major decline is coming mostly from automotive space.\\nUnidentified Analyst : Thank you.

Then on the overall pricing environment, are you seeing any differences i.e. intensifying competition because of the lower demand recovery portfolio coming few quarters?\\nChi-Tung Liu: I mean, we are very much aware of the market situation and we respect the foundry market and pricing trends. We are aware of the market dynamic and competitive landscape. So, we will closely monitor in the market in line with our customer on pricing position to ensure our customer's competitiveness. And along with the security market share, that will be our objective. Even given our pricing strategy, in addition, we do believe our value-added technology, manufacturing quality, and capacity alignment support our customers to enhance their market position.  However, we observed an 8-inch market landscape has intensified it, like you said. But we may have to adjust some pricing for some market segments to align with the market dynamics.

In Q3 2023, UMC reported a revenue of approximately $1.77 billion and a gross profit of $633.8 million, resulting in a gross profit ratio of 0.011. The net income for the quarter was $494.7 million, with a net income ratio of 0.009. Operating income was $474.3 million, and EBITDA stood at $780.3 million. These figures suggest a relatively stable financial position during Q3.\n\nHowever, the company has provided guidance indicating that the Q4 gross margin is expected to drop to the low 30% range. This decline is primarily attributed to a decrease in utilization rates and an anticipated 5% decline in shipments. The company is also facing headwinds such as rising carbon costs and depreciation. Despite these challenges, UMC is engaging in cost reduction activities and product mix optimization to mitigate the impact.\n\nIn terms of broader industry context, the semiconductor market has been experiencing fluctuations in demand, particularly in the PC and smartphone segments. UMC is cautiously optimistic about the return of demand, but there are still inventory build-ups in certain market segments that could persist into 2024. The company plans to continue monitoring rush orders and inventory situations closely.\n\nLooking ahead, while specific future revenue or profit projections were not provided in the earnings call, UMC's management expressed optimism about demand recovery and a return to healthier profitability levels. They are budgeting a cash-based CapEx of $3 billion for 2023, indicating ongoing investment in infrastructure and technology.\n\nIn summary, while UMC's Q3 performance was solid, the forecasted trends for Q4 suggest potential pressure on margins and profitability due to external market conditions and internal cost challenges. The company remains focused on strategic initiatives to navigate these headwinds and is cautiously optimistic about future demand recovery."
