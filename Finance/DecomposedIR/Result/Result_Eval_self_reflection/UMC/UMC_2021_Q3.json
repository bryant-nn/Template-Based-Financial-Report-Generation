Although specific year-over-year (YoY) figures aren't detailed, the first three quarters saw a 17% growth, suggesting substantial progress driven by higher wafer shipments, improved loadings, and increased blended average selling prices (ASP). These results align with prior guidance, which anticipated growth due to strong demand and efficient capacity utilization, with production lines operating near full capacity. Strategic factors such as increased capacity utilization, product mix improvements, and robust demand in communication and consumer sectors contributed to this performance. UMC maintains a positive outlook, with a US$2.3 billion capital expenditure budget focused on capacity expansion to support continued demand growth.",

Good evening everyone. Here I would like to update us Third Quarter operating results of UMC. In the Third Quarter, we continue to experience robust chip demand across computing, consumer and communication and segments. Higher 12-inch wafer shipments in the quarter reflects ongoing product mix enhancement and partially contribute to the lift in blended ASP. Overall wafer shipment grew 2.6% quarter-over-quarter to 2.5 million 8-inch equivalent. Revenue from 28 nanometer technologies continued to rise while business engagement in 22 nanometer have that to a growing number of customer tape-outs across wireless display, in IoT markets. further diversifying our product pipeline.

                    "init_answer": "The transcript highlights a robust demand for wafers across various customer segments, particularly in computing, consumer, and communication. The demand is reflected in increased 12-inch wafer shipments, driven by product mix enhancements that contributed to a rise in blended average selling prices (ASP). Specifically, demand for 28-nanometer technologies is growing, and there is increasing engagement in 22-nanometer technologies, especially in wireless display and IoT markets.\n\n### Key Financial Details:\nWhile the financial statement JSON lacks specific figures for revenue or profit, the transcript notes a 2.6% quarter-over-quarter increase in wafer shipments to 2.5 million 8-inch equivalents. This suggests a positive trend in wafer sales volume, which is a critical component of UMC's revenue.\n\n### Context for Financial Performance:\nUMC's focus on expanding its logic and specialty technology portfolio aligns with the observed demand trends. The ongoing P5 and P6 expansion projects at the 12A facility in Tainan indicate strategic investments to capitalize on this demand, which could enhance UMC's market position and financial performance.\n\n### Reasoning for Trends:\nThe demand is driven by structural needs in segments like 5G, electric vehicles (EV), and IoT, where there is significant unfulfilled demand. Technological advancements and the diversification of UMC's product pipeline are key factors contributing to these trends.\n\n### Expectations for Future Performance:\nUMC anticipates that wafer shipment and ASP trends will remain firm in the fourth quarter, supported by full capacity utilization across its facilities. The company expects to outgrow the market's estimated 12% growth rate, leveraging strong customer relationships and technology competitiveness. This outlook suggests continued positive momentum in wafer demand, potentially leading to improved financial outcomes in future quarters."

Could you talk a little bit about what percentage of these process nodes are already specialty where there is a lot more sticky demand compared to what percentage is still like [Indiscernible] digital, that there could be potentially more fluctuation in terms of demand?\\nJason Wang : Right now for the specialty technology is occupied up a little bit over 50% right now. And they are unique and customized to the customer. So it does give you a bit of more stickiness in terms of the customer relationship. In addition to that, there's also a sole-sourced products that we haven't"

That's my first question.\\nJason Wang : Well, first of all we -- like you said, from a short-term wise, we do expect the momentum in our business growth and profitability will continue to be on Q2 -- Q4, 2021, mainly due to the validation from our customers on the key markets and capture the structure demand. And given the value proposition that UMC provide to our customer, including our solutions, sufficient capacity, and the growth path.

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for UMC indicate positive momentum in business growth and profitability extending into 2022. This optimism is attributed to customer validation, capacity increases, productivity improvements, and continued ASP (Average Selling Price) momentum. UMC expects its 2022 growth to outpace the foundry industry, with full capacity utilization anticipated for both 12-inch and 8-inch wafers. The company is focused on long-term partnerships and balancing profit with sustainable growth, rather than exploiting short-term cyclical gains.\n\nHowever, the financial statements for Q3 2021 do not provide specific historical metrics such as revenue, gross profit, or net income. This absence makes it challenging to directly compare historical performance with future projections numerically. Despite this, UMC's strategic initiatives, including disciplined CapEx and customer trust, suggest a robust approach to sustaining growth and mitigating downturn risks.\n\nTo provide a clearer picture, it would be beneficial to have historical financial figures such as past revenue growth rates or profitability margins. Additionally, more detailed future guidance, such as specific revenue growth targets or expected changes in gross margins, would enhance the analysis. This would allow for a more comprehensive comparison between historical performance and forecasted trends, offering stakeholders clearer expectations for UMC's financial trajectory."

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the comprehensiveness and clarity of the financial report answer, we can incorporate the following elements:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details or Numbers**:\n   - While the financial statement JSON does not provide specific figures for revenue, profit, or earnings for Q3 2021, it is crucial to note that UMC anticipates that their 2022 outlook will outpace the foundry industry's growth, which is projected to be in double digits. This expectation is based on strong structural demand and continued ASP momentum.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**:\n   - Historically, UMC has benefited from structural demands in sectors like 5G, EV, and IoT. Despite some softness in wafer demand due to the end of work-from-home trends, these sectors continue to provide a robust growth foundation. Comparing this to previous years, UMC has managed to align its capacity and productivity improvements to capitalize on such demands.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes**:\n   - The strong demand in 5G, EV, and IoT sectors is driven by technological advancements and increased adoption, directly benefiting UMC's operations. Additionally, full capacity utilization on 12-inch and 8-inch wafers, along with productivity improvements, positions UMC to meet these demands efficiently.\n   - Component shortages and rising inventory levels remain risks, as they can lead to supply chain disruptions and potential demand fluctuations, impacting sales and production timelines.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance**:\n   - UMC expects to maintain full capacity utilization and sees ASP momentum continuing into 2022, which should contribute to revenue growth. These expectations align with their strategy of enhancing capacity and productivity.\n   - Detailed guidance for ASP and other financial metrics for 2022 is anticipated to be provided in the Q4 2021 conference call, which will offer more precise targets and expectations for the upcoming fiscal year.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, we provide a more comprehensive view of UMC's financial situation, including both historical context and future expectations, which enhances the depth and usefulness of the analysis."
