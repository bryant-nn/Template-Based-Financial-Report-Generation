But I guess my problem is that I understand you try to sell the value right that if we look at again the LCH of IC, your customers margin keep going down and next year probably their margin will fall to like a pre-COVID level, right maybe 20%, 30%. So, obviously, that is not a value, right. I mean, on your customers margin, the margin are shrinking.

This segment now accounts for 22% of UMC's overall wafer revenue. Although specific revenue figures for other segments are not provided, this growth highlights the strategic importance of the 22/28 nanometer technology in UMC's portfolio.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - While the financial statements do not provide detailed figures for Q2 2022, the transcript indicates that UMC's gross margin was 46.5% for the second quarter. This suggests a strong operational performance, despite challenges such as inflation in wages and materials costs.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - The decline in demand for smartphones, PCs, and consumer electronics is attributed to potential market saturation and economic uncertainties affecting consumer spending. However, this is counterbalanced by increased demand in the communication sector, likely due to ongoing advancements in connectivity technologies and infrastructure investments.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance:**\n   - UMC expects its business to remain firm in the third quarter, with stable pricing and strategic adjustments in product mix and customer portfolios to manage market volatility. The company is optimistic about the long-term prospects of its 22/28 nanometer business, indicating continued focus on applications like OLED display drivers, image processors, and automotive technologies.\n   - Although specific future revenue growth figures are not provided, UMC's emphasis on navigating market fluctuations through diversification and product mix adjustments suggests a proactive approach to sustaining growth and profitability.\n\nBy integrating these elements, the analysis offers a more detailed and informative view of UMC's financial performance and strategic positioning in the semiconductor market."

Although exact sales figures are not provided, this indicates a slight increase in its contribution compared to Q1.\n   - The consumer segment saw a sequential growth of 12% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong performance in sub-segments like power devices, Wi-Fi, Digital TV, set-top boxes, LCD controllers, and MCUs.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - Overall, the company reported a revenue increase of 38.2% year-over-year in Q2 2022, reaching NT$135.4 billion.

Thank you very much. How you think about -- I think different people have asked about pricing, but do you think there is something that has fundamentally changed, because historically pricing goes down in down turn.

Your sales in the second quarter were up 14% sequentially in consumer. And I'd love to understand what's behind that increase and how you see the consumer outlook specifically for the second half of the year? Thank you.\\nJason Wang: Yes, for CapEx spending according to the current schedule, you will be rather second half of this. So we still keep our $3.6 billion numbers. Of course, this is a rolling basis, but I believe the end result won't be too different from the $3.6 billion budget numbers.\\nBrett Simpson: So going to your question about the current segment outlooks.

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends indicate a potential decline in consumer and computing segments for Q3, contrasting with the 14% sequential increase in consumer sales observed in Q2. Although specific financial figures for Q2, such as total revenue, profit, or earnings, are not provided in the available data, the company anticipates maintaining healthy loading due to steady demand from the automotive sector.\n\nHistorically, pricing in the semiconductor industry tends to decrease during downturns. However, the company expects stable or potentially upward-biased pricing even in downturns due to rising costs and inflationary pressures, which is a shift from historical norms. This expectation is partly due to the ability to pass on rising costs to customers, a strategy the company is likely implementing to mitigate the impact of increased costs in wages, materials, and WFE tools.\n\nDespite macroeconomic uncertainties and cost pressures, the company expects moderate growth in the boundary industry. This suggests a deviation from typical downturn patterns, where growth is usually stunted. The company maintains a CapEx budget of $3.6 billion, indicating continued investment in capacity and technology, which supports its growth outlook. This strategic investment, coupled with steady demand in certain sectors, underpins the company's confidence in achieving moderate growth despite the challenging environment."

                    "init_answer": "To improve the answer based on the feedback, we can incorporate specific financial details, historical context, and expectations for future performance. Here's a revised response:\n\n### Revised Answer:\n\nThe key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations for UMC include:\n\n1. **Financial Performance Context**:\n   - Although specific financial figures for Q2 2022 are not provided, understanding UMC's historical performance trends is crucial. Historically, UMC has experienced fluctuations in revenue and profit due to market conditions and demand variability in its key sectors.\n\n2. **Inventory Levels**:\n   - High inventory levels in certain segments pose a risk. The time required to clear these inventories is uncertain, especially under macroeconomic uncertainties. Efficient inventory management will be critical to maintaining cash flow and profitability.\n\n3. **Demand Variability**:\n   - There is a noted softening demand in the smartphone, notebook, and consumer sectors, likely due to market saturation and competitive pressures. However, stable demand in networking, industrial, and automotive segments could help offset this decline. This sectoral demand shift will influence UMC's sales mix and revenue streams.\n\n4. **Cost Inflation**:\n   - Rising costs due to inflation in wages, materials, and equipment could pressure margins. UMC's ability to pass these costs onto customers will be crucial. The company has indicated potential for stable or upward pricing, which could positively influence sales if maintained.\n\n5. **Macroeconomic Uncertainty**:\n   - Broader economic conditions and uncertainties could impact consumer behavior and demand, influencing sales expectations. UMC anticipates moderate industry growth despite these challenges.\n\n6. **Future Performance Expectations**:\n   - Although specific revenue growth or earnings forecasts are not available, UMC expects a more moderate growth trajectory in the boundary industry. The company's strategic focus on stable demand sectors and pricing strategies will be key to achieving favorable sales outcomes.\n\nBy navigating these factors effectively, UMC aims to sustain its financial health and capitalize on stable demand sectors, despite the challenges posed by inventory levels and cost inflation."
