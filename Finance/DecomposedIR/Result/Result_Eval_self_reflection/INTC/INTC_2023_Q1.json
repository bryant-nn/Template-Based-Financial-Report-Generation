And one of the things that we've put a lot of emphasis on with 18A is getting to structural cost parity with what we believe is the best in the industry at that point. So, we view this as not just getting to power and performance parity, but also area parity and cost structural parity as we get to 18A. And we believe, as we've benchmarked ourselves against the industry best, we believe we're on track to do that in the 18A timeframe. And that's part of why we talk about in the internal foundry model as being able to start really measuring the P&L right? I'm really viewing it as the industry price for wafers is understood, and we have to benchmark ourselves against that and deliver margin structure at the wafer level that's competitive with that.\\nJohn Pitzer: Matt, do you have a quick follow-up?\\nMatthew Ramsay: Yes I do John and thank you Pat for the detail there.

One is that you normally have a stronger second half in our industry. We expect that to be the case. Second is we'll have worked through a lot of the inventory issues as you go first half to second half. And we are seeing some green shoots in the marketplace. We think it's a tough market for all, right? And we're navigating through it well, as seen by our top and bottom line beat in Q1. But hey, it's a tough market out there. So we're still being fairly cautious as we look out over time. And then third, obviously, our strengthening execution. Our road map is getting stronger. We're gaining market share. And I think of our Q1 as a solid proof point that we're navigating through the tough environment that we have in a better way than most. So we are incrementally more positive on the second half, but we also believe we have to continue careful execution, careful fiscal discipline as",
                        "based on all those factors. And obviously, we're actively working on our $8 billion to $10 billion of spending reductions by the time we get to the end of 2025, and a lot of that is in the cost base, which will be a benefit to gross margins.\\nJohn Pitzer: Tim, do you have a follow-up?\\nTimothy Arcuri: I do. Yes. Pat, I guess you have a lot of products coming out in a pretty short amount of time. Basically, you've got five data center platforms in 2.5 years. I understand that some are E-core and some are P-core, but usually, customers want to leverage their investments in these platforms for a longer time than that. So could that be some impediment to how quickly these platforms could ramp? Can you kind of talk about that?\\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, it's a great question, Tim. And what I'd highlight is that Sapphire and Emerald Gen 4 and Gen 5 are the same platform. So from the customer's perspective, they get to leverage those platform investments in a substantial way. Similarly, as we go",
                        "question please.\\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my questions. I had a near-term and then a longer-term one. So on the near term, how should we think about the second half? Right now, when I look at consensus expectations. They are set for about 15% to 20% half-on-half growth. I appreciate you're not giving guidance. But is that the kind of growth that is contemplated or reflected in the return to the low 40s gross margin?\\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I think what Pat said is, we thought things would be modestly better in the second half of the year. And that, combined with the fact that pre-PRQ reserves reverse themselves, we'll probably see some better utilization levels. That's what gives us the confidence of comfortably in the 40s, and we're not providing any specific revenue guidance on the second half?\\nPat Gelsinger: Well, I'd say there's three things to just think about for the second half.

This reduction is expected to improve gross margins by lowering the cost base.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance:**\n   - Historically, Intel and the semiconductor industry generally experience stronger performance in the second half of the year due to increased demand. This aligns with Intel's expectation of a stronger second half, driven by improved inventory management and utilization levels.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends or Changes:**\n   - Improved inventory management is expected to lead to better utilization levels, which should enhance operational efficiency and gross margins. The spending reductions will further support margin improvements by decreasing operational costs. These factors, combined with Intel's strengthening execution and market share gains, are anticipated to positively impact financial health.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance:**\n   - Intel is cautiously optimistic about the second half, expecting modest improvements. While not providing specific revenue guidance, Intel anticipates being \"comfortably in the 40s\" in terms of gross margins, suggesting a recovery from previous periods. This expectation is based on industry trends and their internal strategies to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.\n\nIn summary, Intel expects a stronger second half of 2023, driven by improved inventory management, utilization, and significant cost reductions. These strategies are aimed at enhancing gross margins and aligning with historical industry performance trends, though current market challenges necessitate cautious optimism."

Consistent with prior quarters, I'd like to focus my comments in three areas: one, our view of the macro and our markets; two, key highlights from Q1; and three, an update on our strategic priorities with a focus on our move to an internal foundry model. As the industry continues to navigate through multiple global challenges and headwinds, we remain cautious on the macro outlook, even as we expect some modest recovery in the second half. We are seeing increasing stability in the PC market with inventory corrections largely proceeding as we had expected. However, the server and networking markets have yet to reach their bottoms as Cloud and Enterprise remain weak. As a result, our Q2 revenue guide embeds continued inventory corrections in our core markets and a range of normal seasonal to better-than-seasonal growth off depressed Q1 revenue",

That positions us very well for natural improvement in a stronger second half as we're now selling, I'll say, in at the same rate of selling out in the marketplace in a normally stronger back half of the year. Overall, this is just going to be a positive every quarter as we go through the year. We're seeing strong momentum from our customers for our road map. And as Dave indicated, we're already starting to build inventory for the Meteor Lake launch later in the year, which is another strong indication. Dave, if you want to comment on the inventory comment?\\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. So we have about 155 days of inventory aggregate - in the aggregate on the balance sheet. Obviously, as we get through the inventory depletion at customers and we start to normalize back up to the level of end consumption, we'll start to burn through that inventory, and you can expect us to start ramping the factories.

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the analysis of the company's future sales expectations, incorporating specific financial metrics, historical context, and detailed explanations for observed trends is essential. Here’s an improved response:\n\n1. **Macroeconomic Conditions**: The company remains cautious about the macroeconomic outlook. Although specific revenue figures for Q1 are not available, the company reported a top and bottom line beat, indicating better-than-expected performance despite challenging conditions. This suggests resilience in navigating the current economic environment.\n\n2. **Inventory Management**: The company has approximately 155 days of inventory on the balance sheet, indicating a substantial inventory position. As inventory depletion at customers progresses, normalization is expected, which should support future sales. This strategic inventory management is crucial as it aligns supply with anticipated demand recovery in the second half.\n\n3. **Market Stability**: While the PC market shows increasing stability, the server and networking markets remain weak. The company anticipates these markets will bottom out soon, suggesting potential for future recovery. Historical comparison indicates that these segments have been underperforming relative to past periods, affecting overall sales.\n\n4. **Seasonal Growth**: The company expects normal to better-than-seasonal growth in the second half, driven by a traditionally stronger second half in the industry. Historical data typically shows increased sales in the latter half of the year, which aligns with this expectation.\n\n5. **Product Roadmap and Customer Demand**: Strong customer momentum for the company's roadmap and the upcoming Meteor Lake launch are positive indicators for future sales. This suggests that product innovation and customer engagement remain key drivers for growth.\n\n6. **Execution and Market Share**: The company is focusing on strengthening execution and gaining market share. This strategic priority is critical in navigating the challenging market environment and achieving sustainable growth.\n\n**Expectations and Guidance**: While specific future revenue projections are not provided, the company’s cautious optimism about the second half indicates a focus on careful execution and fiscal discipline to drive growth. Stakeholders can expect continued efforts to capitalize on market opportunities and manage risks effectively.\n\nOverall, the company is positioned to leverage its inventory strategy, product launches, and market execution to drive future sales, despite ongoing macroeconomic challenges and market segment weaknesses."
