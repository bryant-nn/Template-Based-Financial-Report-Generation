The aforementioned onetime corporate revenue item in Q1 '21 will also impact the year-on-year compare. We are forecasting gross margin of 52%, EPS of",

Before moving on to Q1 guidance, I want to briefly discuss changes to our non-GAAP reporting beginning in 2022 that we touched on in our Q3 earnings. First, in an effort to more closely align with our semiconductor peers and allow for more consistent comparability between periods, we'll be removing stock-based compensation and all gains and losses related to our ICAP portfolio from our non-GAAP results. Despite this change, we'll continue to closely evaluate stock-based compensation to ensure we're in line with industry benchmarks and optimize ICAP investments to advance our strategy and maximize ROI. Second, we're modifying our segment reporting to align with our revised organizational structure and business strategy. Moving forward, we will report results under the following business units: Client Computing, which includes our historical"

However, the company expects Q1 revenue of $18.3 billion, which represents a 1% year-over-year decline but a 2% increase when adjusted for a one-time corporate revenue item from Q1 '21. This adjustment indicates underlying growth despite the headline decline. \n\nThe company anticipates continued strong demand across all business units, although it faces challenges such as industry-wide component constraints and seasonal factors. While specific segment guidance is not detailed, the company is addressing these challenges through strategic supplier partnerships and inventory management. These efforts are aimed at sustaining growth and capitalizing on strong demand across its segments, despite the external pressures."

But if you look at the cloud part of the business, I think this is the 5th consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines. And so I guess there's 2 parts to my question. One, when do you see a return to year-over-year growth in cloud? And two, to the extent that the investment community has a bias that everything eventually ends up in the cloud, what is kind of your long-term view of the sustainability of this enterprise demand?\\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks for the comments on a great finish to a great year. So as we look at the DCG business, we just say we started out behind early in the year digestion. And we've sort of been catching up and building momentum in the cloud piece of that business all year long. And we do see that momentum carrying into next year.

E&G, really a tremendous second half and a really strong Q4 for that business where we have higher market share and have seen just a great environment. What we're hearing from our customers is that the momentum in E&G continues in the next year with very strong backlog positions, and it would have been even stronger had it not been for other supply constraints and match sets that we see. And as you may have heard me talk about before, we don't see everything going to the cloud. We see this balance of on-prem and cloud-based delivery. And cloud continues to grow faster than on-prem, but workloads continue to grow on-prem.

                    "init_answer": "To improve the financial report answer based on the feedback, let's incorporate specific financial details, context, reasoning for trends, and future expectations:\n\n**Improved Answer:**\n\nThe earnings call transcript highlights two key trends: a strong recovery in enterprise demand and ongoing challenges in the cloud segment. Historically, the cloud part of the business has experienced five consecutive quarters of year-over-year declines. However, the company anticipates building momentum in the cloud segment into the next year, suggesting a potential return to growth. This is likely driven by strategic investments and efforts to enhance cloud offerings, aligning with industry trends where cloud services are expected to grow faster than on-prem solutions.\n\nIn contrast, the enterprise segment has shown significant strength, particularly in the second half of the year, with expectations of continued momentum supported by a strong backlog. This growth is tempered by supply constraints, which have been a common challenge across the tech industry due to global supply chain disruptions.\n\nFor the PC market, the transcript indicates that 2021 was a robust year with approximately 15% growth, and moderate growth is expected in the following year. This aligns with the company's optimistic outlook on the PC market, despite rising channel inventory levels. The company's strategic focus on innovation and market expansion is expected to support this growth trajectory.\n\n**Financial Context:**\nWhile specific financial figures from the financial statement JSON are unavailable, the company's strong performance in the enterprise segment and anticipated recovery in the cloud segment suggest a positive outlook. The company's market position as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing provides a strong foundation for leveraging growth opportunities in both the enterprise and consumer markets.\n\n**Future Expectations:**\nThe company plans to capitalize on the growing demand for cloud and enterprise solutions by enhancing its product offerings and addressing supply chain challenges. Strategic initiatives may include expanding manufacturing capabilities and investing in research and development to drive innovation. These efforts are expected to support sustainable growth and improve financial performance in the coming years.\n\nOverall, the forecasted trends suggest cautious optimism with anticipated growth in both cloud and enterprise segments, supported by strategic initiatives and market dynamics, albeit with challenges such as supply constraints and inventory dynamics to manage."

So a lot of these challenges have really led to, I'll just say, supply issues throughout the customer base. So as we go to next year, we hope to see some of those starting to moderate and turn to a more normal behavior in the industry, in particular, the channel inventory levels, the ones that were essentially zero, right, for almost all of the year. And now we're starting to see just a little bit of build back in that area, which particularly, for our channel and distribution partners, sort of for the first time, giving them something to sell for the whole year. So a lot of response positively there. Overall, we still see that the PC is now becoming this essential part in an increasingly work from home, learn from home environment; Windows 11, a strong upgrade cycle being introduced by that.

So we see that we will be able to have continued growth in our client business. And obviously, with a stronger and stronger product line, we see ourselves in a very good position for our client market share. Now the inventory position is one where we have just been at historically low inventories for an extended period of time, just racing to catch up with demand. And so we would say that some of this is just getting to inventory levels that are even approaching what we consider normal for a business of this size and one that's managing these still significant supply constraints at different areas, power controllers, display led controllers, other aspects of substrates and different component pieces.

However, specific financial metrics such as revenue, profit, or earnings figures for Intel are not provided in the financial statement JSON. This lack of data limits the ability to quantify the company's financial performance.\n   - Suggestion: Intel's recent quarterly or annual revenue and profit figures would help to contextualize the discussion about sales expectations. Unfortunately, these figures are not available in the provided JSON.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance:**\n   - The PC market is experiencing growth, driven by the increasing necessity of PCs in work-from-home and learn-from-home environments. The introduction of Windows 11 is expected to drive a strong upgrade cycle.\n   - While the transcript mentions optimism for modest growth in the market next year, specific comparisons to industry peers or historical performance are not provided.\n   - Suggestion: Including a comparison of Intel's growth with industry benchmarks or historical data would provide valuable context.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes:**\n   - Significant supply constraints are noted, particularly in areas such as power controllers and display controllers. These constraints are part of a broader global semiconductor shortage impacting many industries.\n   - The transcript suggests that inventory levels, which were historically low, are beginning to build back, potentially moderating supply issues and allowing channel partners to have products to sell throughout the year.\n   - Suggestion: A more detailed explanation of the global supply chain disruptions and their specific impact on Intel's operations would enhance understanding.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance:**\n   - The transcript mentions expectations for modest market growth next year, with a structurally larger market and a couple of percent growth anticipated.\n   - However, specific forward-looking guidance from Intel, such as expected revenue growth rates or profit margins, is not provided in the transcript or financial statement JSON.\n   - Suggestion: Including any official guidance or forecasts from Intel for upcoming quarters or fiscal years would provide clearer expectations for future performance.\n\nThe analysis would benefit from the inclusion of specific financial metrics and official guidance to provide a more comprehensive view of Intel's financial outlook and the factors influencing its future sales expectations."
