The shift towards more leading-edge wafers, particularly those produced using EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) technology, has resulted in significantly better margins compared to pre-EUV nodes. This transition allows for better pricing on EUV wafers, enhancing the overall ASP.\n\n1. **Key Financial Details or Numbers**: While specific figures for the percentage increase in wafer ASP are not provided in the transcript or financial statement, the overall improvement in pricing dynamics is evident from the shift to EUV technology. For instance, Intel's revenue for Q2 2024 was $12.833 billion, with a gross profit of $4.547 billion, indicating the positive impact of higher ASPs on financial performance.\n\n2. **Context for the Company's Financial Performance**: The increase in wafer ASP contributes positively to Intel's financial performance by improving gross margins. The gross profit ratio for Q2 2024 was approximately 35.43%, which reflects the benefit of higher ASPs as part of the company's strategy to enhance profitability through advanced technology offerings.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes**: The adoption of EUV technology and the alignment of competitive processes with customer demands have led to increased ASPs. EUV technology provides cost efficiencies and meets market demand for advanced semiconductor technology, which justifies the higher pricing and contributes to better margins.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidances for Future Performance**: Looking forward, Intel anticipates continued improvement in pricing as it progresses through the next few years.

                    "init_answer": "To provide a more comprehensive analysis of wafer demand trends across different customer segments, let's integrate specific financial details and contextual insights:\n\n1. **Financial Performance Context**:\n   - In Q2 2024, Intel reported a revenue of $12.833 billion. Despite the challenges in the client business, which is expected to be flat to down, the data center and edge markets are anticipated to experience modest growth. This indicates a shift in wafer demand towards these segments.\n   - The company's gross profit for Q2 was $4.547 billion, with a gross profit ratio of 35.43%. This suggests that while there are pressures on margins due to inventory adjustments and export controls, Intel's financial health remains robust enough to support growth in strategic areas.\n\n2. **Key Financial Details**:\n   - Intel's net income for Q2 2024 was a loss of $1.61 billion, reflecting the impact of ongoing market dynamics and strategic investments in new manufacturing nodes.\n   - The company is projecting Q3 revenue between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion, with a midpoint of $13 billion, indicating expectations for a slight revenue increase despite current challenges.\n\n3. **Reasoning and Explanations**:\n   - The flat to downtrend in the client business is primarily due to customers reducing inventory and the negative effects of export controls. These factors are likely causing a temporary dip in wafer demand for consumer products.\n   - Conversely, the modest growth in data center and edge markets suggests increased demand for wafers in these segments, driven by enterprise refresh cycles and the adoption of advanced technologies like AI.\n\n4. **Future Expectations and Guidance**:\n   - Intel anticipates healthier inventory positions by the end of Q3, which should bolster revenue growth at the high end of seasonal expectations in Q4.\n   - The company is focusing on ramping up AI PC products and advanced packaging technologies, which are expected to drive future wafer demand and improve margins due to better pricing on EUV wafers.\n\nIn summary, while certain segments face short-term challenges, Intel is strategically positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities in data center, edge markets, and advanced packaging technologies, with an optimistic outlook for improved wafer demand and financial performance in the upcoming quarters."

I guess my first question is on the client space. I think, Dave, you might have mentioned client flat to down in September. I think your primary x86 competitor is going to be up double-digits or I think they mentioned above seasonal, however, you quantify seasonal now. Maybe you could give us a little color there. There's lots of maybe noise in the system about ARM coming into the client market, I think that impact would be more modest relative to what you described. But if you could kind of give us puts and takes there and how the inventory with OEMs might be affecting what you're guiding for since September. Thanks.\\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes.

We remain confident that we have and will continue to make the investments needed to drive long-term shareholder value and we view cost discipline as the compass that drives effective execution, helping teams stay on track to both prioritize and achieve measurable results. The operational and capital improvements we are driving will be especially important as we manage the business through the near term. While we expect to deliver sequential revenue growth through the rest of the year, the pace of the recovery will be slower than expected, which is reflected in our Q3 outlook. Specifically, Q3 will be impacted by a modest inventory digestion in CCG with DCAI and our more cyclical businesses of NEX, Altera, and Mobileye trending below our original forecast. Our outlook reflects industry-wide conditions without any meaningful change in our market share expectations. As we look into Q4, normal seasonal revenue growth has",
                        "follow-up on the first two, and Pat, maybe just ask it a different way. Part of what you're saying, it sounds like you're adjusting your spending across the board to reflect the macro reality, slower growth, et cetera, et cetera, but it seems like that would be difficult to do if it didn't impact any of the structural dynamics as well. So I guess the real question is, are there any changes either to your competitiveness, the structure of the company, the long-term $100 billion target that you just saw weren't happening and therefore felt these cuts were necessary, so do any of the structural changes -- or can you describe any of the structural changes and what the outcome to your financial targets might be?\\nPatrick Gelsinger: Yes, let me point you back to what I said at the start. We started this forensics, this clean sheet analysis concurrent with the rolling out of our new operational model. We said we have to be a world-class foundry. We are going to benchmark ourselves against"

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for Intel indicate a slower-than-expected recovery with sequential revenue growth anticipated for the remainder of the year. This is primarily due to modest inventory digestion in the Client Computing Group (CCG) and lower-than-expected performance in Data Center and AI (DCAI), Network and Edge (NEX), Altera, and Mobileye segments. Historically, Intel has experienced fluctuations in revenue and market conditions, but the current outlook reflects a cautious approach with no significant change in market share expectations.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Intel reported revenue of $12.83 billion, a gross profit of $4.547 billion with a gross profit margin of 35.43%, and a net loss of $1.61 billion, translating to an earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.38. The operating income was negative at $1.021 billion, highlighting ongoing challenges in profitability. These results contrast with Intel's efforts to adjust spending and manage costs to drive long-term shareholder value.\n\nKey factors influencing these trends include competitive pressures, particularly in the x86 market, and potential impacts from ARM's entry into the client market. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions and supply chain issues may have contributed to the slower recovery.\n\nLooking ahead, Intel plans to focus on operational and capital improvements to navigate these near-term challenges effectively. The company remains committed to its strategic initiatives, such as becoming a world-class foundry and maintaining cost discipline to prioritize and achieve measurable results. While specific guidance for future performance is not detailed, Intel aims to leverage these strategies to enhance its competitiveness and improve financial outcomes in the coming quarters."

We want to get these restructurings done quickly so that we can move forward more aggressively with the product lines next year. In terms of the long-term forecast, we're clearly tempering our view of how fast we can grow in the near-term based on the market conditions. But our model is built that we will scale up or scale down the capital requirements appropriate to the market conditions we see. We believe the long-term guidance that we've given you, the 60:40, getting to the Foundry business model we've described, the growth areas that we've said, those are larger portions of our business. We believe those are long-term still achievable in that regard and we're on track for many of those things in the models that we're laying out and today's actions will help accelerate us achieving those.\\nJohn Pitzer: Ross, do you have a quick follow-up?\\nRoss Seymore: Yes, I do.

So we remain very comfortable with our earlier comments in that area. I'd say, we do believe that we'll have further updates there, but as we've also indicated, customers are reluctant to put their name out there given the supply base and the traditional operation of the Foundry industry. Overall, things are looking on track for what we've said with a meaningful acceleration in packaging over the last quarter, more updates to come. Maybe with that, John, I'll wrap us up. Thank you for joining our call. We appreciate the time as always.
