So that’s certainly helpful. Obviously, with the increase in core count, that affects the cost as well. So, cost obviously goes up. But the longer -- the larger drivers of our cost structure will be around what we do in terms of the internal foundry model as we get up in terms of scale and get away from these underloading charges, and as we get past the start-up costs on 5 nodes in 4 years, which data center is certainly getting hit with. And so those things, I think, longer term will be the biggest drivers of gross margin improvement.

The company has not provided specific sales figures, but these conditions suggest potential challenges.\n\n4. **Overall Market and Strategic Context**:\n   - The company has exited nine lines of business, resulting in annual savings of more than $1.7 billion, and is implementing austerity measures to improve operational efficiency.\n   - Inventory levels have normalized, which could help stabilize supply and demand dynamics across segments.\n   - The company is focusing on strategic sales and attractive deals to accelerate demand, which could influence future performance positively.\n\nIn summary, while specific segment sales guidance is not provided, the company outlines expectations for growth in the IFS and Mobileye segments and stabilization in the client CPU segment. The data center, network, and edge markets face some challenges due to external conditions."

And then the last factor was one of the first question from Ross around the pressure from accelerator spend being stronger. So, I think those four somewhat together, right, are leading to a bit of weakness, at least through Q3. That said, our overall position is strengthening and we’re seeing our products improve, right? We’re seeing the benefits of the AI capabilities and our Gen 4 and beyond products improving.

Congrats on the strong results. I wanted to focus, Pat, on the data center, the DCAI side of things. Strong upside in the quarter but it sounds like there’s still some mix trends going forward. So, I guess a two-part question. Can you talk about what drove the upside and where the concern is going forward? And part of that concern, that crowding out potential that you just discussed with, accelerators versus CPUs, how is that playing out and when do you expect it to end?\\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ross, and thanks for the congrats on the quarter as well. I’m super proud of my team for the great execution this quarter, top, bottom line, beats, raise, just great execution across every aspect of the business, both financially as well as road map execution. With regard to the data center, obviously, the good execution, I’ll just say we"

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for Intel indicate both challenges and opportunities as the company navigates its financial landscape. Historically, Intel faced a decline in Q3 due to several factors, including data center digestion, enterprise weakness, inventory issues, and a slower-than-expected recovery in the China market. Despite these challenges, Intel remains optimistic about strengthening its position with improved products, particularly in AI capabilities and CPUs.\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\n- **Total Revenue for Q2 2023:** $12.949 billion\n- **Net Income:** $1.481 billion\n- **Gross Profit Margin:** 35.82%\n- **Operating Income:** -$1.016 billion (indicating ongoing operational challenges)\n- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** $0.35\n\n**Context for Financial Performance:**\nThe Q2 2023 performance shows signs of recovery with a positive net income and a gross profit margin indicating some profitability. However, the negative operating income highlights continued operational challenges. Historically, the company was impacted by industry-wide issues such as data center digestion and market recovery, particularly in China.\n\n**Reasoning for Trends and Changes:**\nIntel's challenges have been partly due to inventory management and market dynamics. The company's strategic focus on AI capabilities and CPU improvements, such as the upcoming Meteor Lake launch, is expected to address these weaknesses. These product enhancements are anticipated to drive demand and operational efficiency, counteracting past challenges.\n\n**Expectations and Guidance for Future Performance:**\nIntel is confident about achieving sequential growth in its client business, driven by reaching healthy inventory levels and new product launches. While specific future guidance figures were not detailed in the transcript, the company anticipates improvements in demand and operational efficiency. Intel's strategic focus on AI and CPUs, alongside the anticipated success of Meteor Lake, suggests a positive outlook for future financial performance."
