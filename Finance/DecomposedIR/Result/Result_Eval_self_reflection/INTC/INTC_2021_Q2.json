Here’s an improved response incorporating the feedback:\n\n**Improved Answer:**\n\nThe transcript indicates a 47% reduction in wafer costs for the 10-nanometer process in Q2, as mentioned by George Davis. This reduction in wafer ASP (Average Selling Price) is primarily due to the efficiencies gained from ramping up production processes. As production scales up with the 7-nanometer startup ramping, it is expected to further drive down costs over time.\n\n1. **Key Financial Details:**\n   - While specific financial figures for wafer ASP changes are not provided in the transcript or the financial statement JSON, the 47% reduction signifies a significant cost efficiency. Unfortunately, due to the lack of detailed financial data, precise initial and new wafer ASP figures, as well as the direct impact on revenue or profit margins, cannot be provided.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance:**\n   - The financial statement JSON lacks detailed figures for Q2 2021, but the strategic focus on reducing wafer costs aligns with efforts to improve gross margins. The 7-nanometer ramp-up and substrate manufacturing in-house are strategic moves to mitigate supply chain constraints and enhance competitive positioning.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends or Changes:**\n   - Beyond economies of scale, other factors contributing to the reduction in wafer ASP may include technological advancements in manufacturing processes and strategic supplier negotiations. These efforts aim to optimize production efficiency and reduce dependency on external suppliers, thereby lowering costs.\n\n4. **Expectations for Future Performance:**\n   - Looking ahead, the company anticipates continued cost reductions with the 7-nanometer process ramping up. This is expected to improve gross margins further. The strategic initiatives, including enhancing substrate supply capabilities, suggest a focus on sustaining competitive pricing and improving market share.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the company aims to maintain its competitive edge and improve its financial performance, despite the lack of specific numerical data in the provided context."

                        "challenged our sales teams and our factories to remix within a quarter to provide them with the components that they could then match with what their supply chain was providing them so they could get to market. Watching it was super impressive, a little bit scary at times, but the team did a fantastic job.  We did a really good job of eating up a lot of our substrates, some of which we thought we would have available to us in Q3. The supply impact is more of a volume impact. Customers are already starting to mix upwards, so that's usually a positive for gross margin. And if there's upside in the second half, it will come from both higher substrates and the ability -- and a higher mix, and that could well be the case.  We were cautious. Q3, we could see we had a real supply challenge, it's acute. But Q4, we're doing everything we can to help our substrate suppliers increase supply, including finishing up some of their manufacturing in our own facilities, which is something we could do",
                        "confident of our future. Under IDM 2.0, our factory network continues to deliver and we are now manufacturing more 10-nanometer wafers than 14-nanometer. As 10-nanometer volumes ramp, economics are improving with 10-nanometer wafer cost 45% lower year-over-year with more to come. We will talk more about our plans for process and packaging leadership in our Intel Accelerated event this Monday.  I hope you will join me for the critical update. On our path back to unquestioned product leadership, customers continue to choose Intel. Using our broad portfolio of assets, we will continue to compete aggressively for market segment share. In Q1, we gained PC share with record notebook sales, following that with record Q2 revenue. We launched 12 new processors and Tiger Lake is ramping even better than expected with more than 50 million units shipped to-date.  Finally, our future client roadmap remains strong and we expect to ship several million units of Alder Lake to customers in the second"

The growth of our core client business is up 14%, when we exclude the impact of the ramping down Apple modem business and the exit of our home gateway business. This shows the strong underlying growth in our client business despite a supply constrained environment. Platform ASPs in client were up 4% sequentially on richer mix within notebook and increased desktop volume.  On a year-over-year basis, the strength in consumer entry and education led to lower overall ASPs. Operating income was $3.8 billion up 32% year-over-year on"

First off, year-over-year, you've got significant factory start-up costs embedded for them which as you look at our operating margin. I would say another thing that people maybe are overlooking is our OpEx investments. We have significantly increased the OpEx and key areas of the Company even as we've taken down about $2 billion of OpEx since 2018 on various Portfolio actions.  And the DCG and the Xeon product line is absolutely critical to the Company. And so we have substantially increased OpEx within that as well, so that's the second largest impact. and we're going to continue to do that for as long as it's needed. And as you know, ultimately, it is your product competitiveness that gives you more flexibility to drive up ASPs further from today and drive higher gross margins.

I have a question on depreciation. It's been coming down sequentially for the last several quarters. It was actually down again sequentially this quarter. How is that possible given the CapEx ramp? Like what's going on there? And how do we think about depreciation's impact in gross margin going forward, given it's run rating under $10 billion annually and your CapEx is now going to $20 billion annually. Like how do we think about those?\\nGeorge Davis: Yes, Stacy, so the absolute numbers are down -- are trending what is counter-intuitively, and really it's NAND moving from non-GAAP into GAAP. There's no depreciation for the NAND business anymore, as it's under the accounting once it's held for sale. It's an anomaly. Yes, we expect depreciation to increase as we're ramping CapEx over the next several years. And again, in",

And I really wanted to understand, why is it lower this time? And perhaps even much more importantly, going forward, is there anything structurally that is going to stop that from returning back to the 40% to 50% operating margin range you guys have historically driven. Competitive dynamics, need to catch up on the manufacturing side, so you have headwinds there. People customizing more cloud competition internally, any of those dynamics that would stop you from getting back to that range? Thanks.\\nGeorge Davis: Yeah, thanks. Maybe starting at the latter part of your question. There's no long-term reason why you could not see DCG return to more historical margins.

                    "init_answer": "To improve the financial report answer, we will incorporate specific financial figures, provide broader market context, elaborate on the strategic rationale behind investments, and offer detailed future guidance. Here is the revised answer:\n\n**Revised Financial Report Answer:**\n\nThe forecasted trends for the company indicate a strategic period of increased operational expenditures (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx) compared to historical performance. Historically, the company maintained operating margins in the range of 40% to 50%. Currently, operating margins are approximately 10 percentage points lower, in the mid-20s, due to significant factory start-up costs and increased OpEx investments, particularly in the DCG and Xeon product lines.\n\n**Key Financial Details:**\n- The company is ramping up its CapEx to $20 billion annually, a significant increase from previous levels, to enhance its manufacturing capabilities and product offerings.\n- Depreciation has been decreasing sequentially despite the CapEx ramp, mainly because the NAND business is held for sale and its depreciation has been temporarily removed from the financials. This trend is expected to reverse as CapEx continues to increase, leading to higher future depreciation expenses.\n\n**Context for Financial Performance:**\nThe semiconductor industry is experiencing robust demand, driven by the proliferation of digital technologies and increased data center investments. However, competitive dynamics and the need for technological advancements are compelling the company to invest heavily in its product lines to maintain and enhance market share.\n\n**Reasoning for Investments:**\nThe increased OpEx and CapEx are strategic investments aimed at bolstering the company's competitive position. By investing in the DCG and Xeon product lines, the company expects to improve product competitiveness, drive up average selling prices (ASPs), and eventually achieve higher gross margins. These investments are essential to address the competitive landscape and technological demands of the market.\n\n**Expectations for Future Performance:**\nWhile short-term pressures on margins are evident due to these strategic investments and start-up costs, the company anticipates a return to historical margin levels as these investments begin to yield returns. The company expects to see improvements in product competitiveness and market share, which should translate into revenue growth and margin recovery over the next few years. The management has not provided a specific timeline, but the strategic focus remains on achieving long-term profitability and shareholder value.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, the revised answer offers a more complete and informative analysis of the company's financial report, addressing both current challenges and future opportunities."

                        "-- some of that factored into our second half. We do hope to continue to overachieve in that area. And if I'd say, why did we overachieve so much in Q2? The heroes for the quarter for us were our manufacturing and operations team. They just did a superb job for us, and really relying on them from the second half, and as George said, hey, if there's more opportunity for us to overachieve on the guide that we set for the second half, it's going to come at the hands of their ability to essentially create more out of nothing; find capacity in the industry, build it out.  And we're doing quite well in this respect, but overall, it is a constrained environment. And as a result, we and everybody else, we're trying to drive our factories harder, drive yields better, and be able to improve the supply chain of the industry.

And as you think about regaining product dominance, how do you use pricing to kind of maintain a share as you get your feet back underneath you?\\nPat Gelsinger: Yeah. And broadly speaking, my comments will be a little bit specific to start with on the datacCenter business proper. Data center business good, good recovery in Q2. And with that there was some ASP decline, some of that's competitive driven. A little bit of that is mix-driven, but a bit more competitive.  Our outlook there is, is that we see fairly stable pricing and market segment share in the data center business for the second half of the year. And that's driven by, I will just say, we're bringing everything we got to the table to continue to win back the market, and with that, our software resources, our deep investments with our customers, the increasing strength of our product line.

Watching it was super impressive, a little bit scary at times, but the team did a fantastic job.  We did a really good job of eating up a lot of our substrates, some of which we thought we would have available to us in Q3. The supply impact is more of a volume impact. Customers are already starting to mix upwards, so that's usually a positive for gross margin. And if there's upside in the second half, it will come from both higher substrates and the ability -- and a higher mix, and that could well be the case.  We were cautious. Q3, we could see we had a real supply challenge, it's acute. But Q4, we're doing everything we can to help our substrate suppliers increase supply, including finishing up some of their manufacturing in our own facilities, which is something we could do"

This is crucial in a constrained supply environment. Moreover, the consistent strong demand driven by global digitalization trends is expected to bolster sales, particularly in the data center business, where the company is focusing on enhancing its product line and leveraging software resources and customer investments to regain market share.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, specific figures from the financial statement are not available, but the company has reported a significant overachievement in Q2, primarily attributed to its operational efficiencies. The transcript indicates a year-over-year growth expectation of about 7%, suggesting a positive trajectory in revenue growth.\n\nRisks impacting future sales expectations include the ongoing supply constraints, which pose challenges to meeting the robust demand. Competitive pressures could also affect pricing and market share. The company is actively working to mitigate these risks by improving substrate supply and optimizing manufacturing processes.\n\nFor future performance expectations, the company anticipates stable pricing and market segment share in the data center business for the second half of the year. This outlook is supported by the company's strategic investments in product development and customer relationships.\n\nOverall, while the financial statement lacks specific figures, the qualitative insights from the earnings call provide a positive outlook for future sales, driven by operational efficiencies and strong market demand, albeit tempered by supply chain challenges and competitive pressures."
