This exceeded the company's guidance midpoint by $300 million, driven by strong execution across segments, particularly in gaming, commercial, and notebook shipments. The Client Computing Group (CCG) saw a 12% QoQ and 33% YoY revenue increase. Factors contributing to the revenue rise included normalized inventory levels and robust PC consumption. Despite a slightly subseasonal Q1 2024 outlook due to inventory corrections in Mobileye and PSG, Intel remains focused on its IDM 2.0 strategy and expects increased gross CapEx in 2024.",

Yes, to be clear, the way I was looking at gross margins is on a year-over-year basis on the 60% fall-through. So you should take the full year gross margins that we had in '23, which were roughly 43.5%. And think about this 60% fall-through based on the 43.6% gross margins.

This is reflected in the sequential revenue decline, with a $1 billion impact from businesses outside core products.\n\n2. **Growth in External Foundry Customer Demand:**\n   - There is a significant uptick in lifetime deal value for external foundry customers, indicating healthy growth. This suggests a shift in demand dynamics, where external foundry customers are driving growth despite traditional wafer equipment demand being weak.\n\n3. **Financial Impact:**\n   - In Q4 2023, Intel reported revenue of $15.406 billion and a net income of $2.669 billion. The cyclical weakness in wafer equipment demand likely impacted these figures, while growth in external foundry customers may help offset this in the future.\n\n4. **Broader Context:**\n   - The overall market conditions remain positive, with expectations for the Total Addressable Market (TAM) to grow in the low single digits in 2024. This aligns with the company's longer-term forecasts and the anticipated growth in AI-driven PC demand.\n\n5. **Reasons for Trends:**\n   - The cyclical weakness may be due to broader industry trends, such as shifts in technology and purchasing cycles. The growth in external foundry demand could be driven by Intel's strategic focus on advanced packaging and differentiated technology, as well as new manufacturing facilities like the one in New Mexico.\n\n6. **Future Expectations:**\n   - Intel is focusing on advanced packaging and building new manufacturing facilities, which are expected to positively influence wafer demand. The company anticipates improvement in data center revenue through 2024, suggesting a recovery and potential growth in wafer demand aligned with these strategic initiatives.\n\nBy integrating these elements, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of wafer demand trends, financial impacts, reasons for observed changes, and future expectations, aligning with Intel's strategic direction and market conditions."

I had a question about gross margin. It was obviously much, much better in December, and the March guidance is actually pretty good. So does this include the sale of any previously written down inventory and maybe help us get a clean margin number? Is this March number pretty clean that we can carry that incremental forward through the year?\\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I mean - what I said in the prepared remarks, I think, is that we think that a 60% fall through is probably the best rule of thumb.

Yes, to be clear, the way I was looking at gross margins is on a year-over-year basis on the 60% fall-through. So you should take the full year gross margins that we had in '23, which were roughly 43.5%. And think about this 60% fall-through based on the 43.6% gross margins. I think when you do that, we obviously start off at a level that's better on a year-over-year basis, but obviously down on quarter-to-quarter basis. And so, you should expect generally improving dynamics through the year. The only challenge will be this quarter-to-quarter always has volatility to it.

We're going to have these quarter-to-quarter movements that kind of violate that, because of just one-off things. But I think in general, you'll see 60% fall through be the right measure.

Obviously, as we come into the year, it's coming off a very strong Q4. Our product lines are strong. We feel our inventory positions are healthy. We're gaining momentum across it. And obviously, we've built the forecast consistent with our customers and channel partners that we believe is merited. Obviously, Dave talked about some of the discrete events, which as we added them up, were a little bit larger than we forecast, but the core business we see is healthy. For it, we see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger. So, we'll say it really reflects as we view the market, but we've also said, hey, we're improving every quarter as we go through the year, like improving on revenue, top line, improving on profitability as we go through the year. And we've quite scrutinized that outlook for the year. And obviously, as the year improves, new",

Dave, you were helpful in breaking up kind of the non-core impacts in the first quarter versus the core, but the low end of seasonality is a little bit of a surprise given that cyclical pressures seem to have been abating and some of the market share trends should have been going in your favor, at least also not worsening. So can you just talk a little bit about why you're at the low end of seasonality in the first quarter for your core businesses and what gives you confidence in super seasonality thereafter?\\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Hi, thanks, Ross. I'll start and ask Dave to follow-up. And first, what's seasonality Q4 to Q1? There's a wide range of perspectives, anywhere from 3% to 20% historically. So I'll just say it's a wide statement, of what that looks like. Obviously, as we come into the year, it's coming off a very strong Q4. Our product",
                        "So as we look at the market year-on-year, we expect it to be a few points bigger than it was last year. So last year was 270. This year, a couple of points higher than that. I think that's consistent with the various market forecasters that we have. Our market share position is very stable. We had good execution of market share through last year. And the product line is better this year with a number of tailwinds, like we said. So overall, we think it's going to be a very solid year for us in our client business. Obviously, as we start the year, everybody is, I'll say, managing through what their Q1 outlook looks like, even as they expect to see stronger business as we go through the year. I'd also comment, Ben, that some of these tailwinds really only start to materialize as you go into second quarter and second half. AIPC is just ramping right now. The Windows 10 EOS goes into effect. And customers are starting to look at the post-COVID refreshes. So a lot of those benefits"

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for the company indicate an expectation of improvement throughout the year, with revenue and profitability anticipated to grow each quarter. Historically, the company has experienced a wide range of seasonality from 3% to 20%. Despite starting the year at the low end of this range, the company is confident in achieving \"super seasonality\" thereafter, driven by stronger product lines, stable market share, and tailwinds such as the AIPC ramp-up and Windows 10 EOS.\n\nFor a more detailed financial context:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details**: In Q4 2023, the company reported a revenue of $15.406 billion and a net income of $2.669 billion, with a gross profit margin of approximately 45.74%. The EBITDA for the quarter was $5.098 billion, reflecting a strong operational performance.\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Last year's market size was $270 billion, and the company expects the market to be a few points larger this year. Comparing to historical performance, the company has maintained a stable market share and has executed well in past years, as indicated by their strong Q4 results.\n\n3. **Reasoning for Trends**: The anticipated improvements are attributed to stronger product lines, stable market share, and significant tailwinds such as the AIPC ramp-up and the Windows 10 EOS. These factors are expected to enhance revenue and profitability as they materialize, particularly in the second quarter and the latter half of the year.\n\n4. **Future Expectations**: The company expects to see a few points increase in market size year-on-year. While specific guidance figures for future revenue or profit are not provided, the company anticipates achieving significant growth driven by internal improvements and favorable market conditions. This suggests a positive financial outlook compared to historical performance.\n\nIn summary, the company is positioned for a solid year with anticipated growth in market size and internal improvements contributing to enhanced financial performance."

                    "init_answer": "To enhance the analysis of key drivers and risks influencing future sales expectations, let's incorporate specific financial details, historical context, and reasoning:\n\n### Key Drivers Influencing Future Sales Expectations:\n\n1. **Strong Product Lines**: The company has emphasized the robustness of its product lines, which is a critical driver for sustaining and potentially increasing sales. This strength is expected to capitalize on market momentum and consumer demand.\n\n2. **Healthy Inventory Positions**: With inventory levels reported as healthy, the company is well-positioned to meet anticipated demand without significant supply chain disruptions. This readiness supports the company's ability to fulfill orders promptly.\n\n3. **Market Momentum**: The company has noted a positive market momentum, which suggests a favorable environment for growth. This momentum is likely driven by an increase in demand for the company's offerings and a recovery from previous cyclical pressures.\n\n4. **Revenue and Profitability Improvements**: The company has projected improvements in both revenue and profitability throughout the year. In Q4 2023, the company reported a revenue of $15.406 billion and a net income of $2.669 billion, reflecting a net income ratio of 17.32%. This financial strength underpins its confidence in future sales growth.\n\n### Risks Influencing Future Sales Expectations:\n\n1. **Discrete Events**: The company has encountered discrete events that exceeded forecasts, posing potential risks if not managed effectively. These events could include unexpected market changes or operational challenges.\n\n2. **Seasonality Variability**: Sales are subject to seasonality, with historical fluctuations ranging from 3% to 20%. This variability introduces uncertainty in sales projections, particularly in the first quarter, which is at the lower end of seasonality.\n\n3. **Quarterly Volatility**: There is an acknowledgment of potential quarter-to-quarter volatility, which could impact sales forecasts. This volatility might stem from variations in demand or supply chain dynamics.\n\n4. **Cyclical Pressures**: Although these pressures are reportedly abating, they could still pose a risk if they resurface or persist, potentially affecting market conditions and consumer spending.\n\n### Historical Context and Future Guidance:\n\n- **Historical Performance**: The company's revenue for Q4 2023 was $15.406 billion, with a gross profit of $7.047 billion. These figures provide a strong foundation for the expected improvements in 2024.\n\n- **Future Expectations**: The company anticipates a few percentage points of growth in the client market compared to last year's $270 billion market size, indicating optimism about capturing additional market share.\n\nBy integrating these financial metrics, historical context, and detailed reasoning, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing future sales expectations and the associated risks."
