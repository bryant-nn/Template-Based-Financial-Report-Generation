Year-over-year, revenue grew significantly, driven by factors like disciplined spending, inventory management, and a one-time asset sale credit. Key segments like Intel Foundry Services and Mobileye showed strong growth. Despite a net income of $297 million and EPS of $0.07, operating income was slightly negative due to challenges like elevated inventory. For Q4, Intel projects revenue between $14.6 billion and $15.6 billion, with higher expected operating expenses. The company remains focused on strategic initiatives to drive future growth.",

However, we can provide a more comprehensive analysis based on the available financial data and context:\n\n1. **Key Financial Details**: While specific wafer sales volume figures are not provided, Intel's overall revenue for Q3 2023 was $14.158 billion, with a gross profit of $6.018 billion and a net income of $297 million. These figures indicate a return to profitability for Intel, despite ongoing challenges such as elevated inventory levels and weak demand.\n\n2. **Context for Financial Performance**: The transcript highlights that Intel is working through elevated inventory and weak demand, which are expected to persist through the end of the year. Nevertheless, Intel Foundry Services (IFS) reported significant revenue growth, with $311 million in Q3, growing 4 times year-over-year and 34% sequentially. This suggests strong performance in specific segments, which could indirectly affect wafer sales.\n\n3. **Reasoning or Explanations for Trends or Changes**: The improvement in factory loadings and reduction in underload charges are operational changes that could positively impact future sales and profitability. These improvements suggest that Intel is optimizing its production processes, which may lead to better financial performance in upcoming quarters.\n\n4. **Expectations or Guidance for Future Performance**: Management indicated confidence in inventory normalization and expects the total addressable market (TAM) for PCs to grow back to 300 million. This positive outlook, along with disciplined spending and focused portfolio management, suggests potential for improved financial performance in the future.\n\nIn summary, while specific wafer sales volume data for Q3 2023 is not available, Intel's financial results show a return to profitability, with strong performance in certain segments and operational improvements that may benefit future sales.

However, several factors are influencing potential variations:\n\n1. **Increased Demand for Advanced Technology**: The transcript mentions a significant surge in interest from AI customers for Intel's advanced packaging technology. This heightened demand for cutting-edge technology can lead to an increase in wafer ASP as customers are willing to pay a premium for advanced features.\n\n2. **Manufacturing Efficiencies**: Improvements in factory underload conditions and manufacturing processes are noted. While these efficiencies could reduce costs, they might also allow Intel to maintain or increase ASP by offering enhanced product capabilities without raising prices significantly.\n\n3. **Ongoing Underload Impact**: Despite improvements, the ongoing underload hangover and associated costs tied up in wafer inventory may counterbalance potential ASP increases. This suggests that while there is room for ASP growth, it may be tempered by these lingering costs.\n\n4. **Company's Financial Performance Context**: Intel reported a gross profit of $6,018 million for Q3 2023, with a gross profit ratio of 42.51%. This indicates a relatively healthy margin, which could support stable or increasing ASPs if the demand for advanced technology continues.\n\n5. **Future Expectations**: The transcript implies optimism about future opportunities impacting gross margins positively, with confidence around achieving a 60% gross margin in the future. This suggests a strategic focus on improving ASP through enhanced product offerings and market positioning.\n\n6. **Industry Trends**: While specific industry comparisons are not detailed, the growing interest in AI and advanced packaging technologies aligns with broader industry trends towards more sophisticated semiconductor solutions, which could support higher ASPs.\n\nIn summary, while specific ASP figures are not provided, the combination of increased demand for advanced technologies, manufacturing efficiencies, and a strategic focus on margin improvement suggests a positive outlook for wafer ASP.

So a critical milestone on 18A. But the other thing that we saw this quarter, which was a little bit unexpected was this huge surge in interest for AI customers and Intel's advanced packaging technology. And this is the 1 that probably we didn't even quite realize. We always knew that Intel's packaging technology was the best in the industry, but the amount of interest that we've seen. So we completed two additional customers, so three 18A wafer customers, two additional packaging customers, and we have a pipeline that we're in active negotiations with six additional packaging customers as well.

I'm curious, Dave, I know last quarter, I think it was, I want to say it was $220-or-so million factory underload impact in gross margin. It sounds like you had a reversal of inventory reserve and gross margin this quarter. Are we done with the factory underload or what was that number? And how are you thinking about that embedded in the gross margin guide?\\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I mean, it was a meaningful benefit, the underload improvement in the quarter. That said, there was still a reasonable amount of underload charges in the quarter. That does improve a bit in the fourth quarter. But we'll be kind of dealing with this underload hangover, I'd call it, probably all through next year as we kind of progress, largely in part because while we will improve the loadings and probably get beyond underload charges on a quarterly basis, we'll still have all of that underload kind of tied up in the cost of the wafers in inventory,"
                    ],
                    "init_answer": "The demand for Intel's wafer services is showing a strong upward trend, particularly driven by AI customers and those interested in advanced packaging technology. This demand is expected to result in significant revenue over the next two to three quarters, with wafer customers potentially contributing billions of dollars in revenue. This is faster than the typical two to three years required for other segments to realize revenue. The transcript indicates that Intel completed engagements with three 18A wafer customers and two additional packaging customers, with active negotiations with six more packaging customers.\n\nFinancially, Intel's overall performance in Q3 2023 showed a gross profit of $6.018 billion on a revenue of $14.158 billion, with a gross profit ratio of 42.51%. While the company faced underload charges impacting the gross margin, there was an improvement in underload conditions during the quarter. This suggests that increased wafer demand could positively impact these figures in the future as Intel potentially reduces underload charges and increases production efficiency.\n\nThe strong interest from AI customers and advancements in packaging technology are key drivers behind the increased wafer demand. Market dynamics, such as the growing importance of AI and the need for advanced semiconductor solutions, are fueling this trend. Moreover, Intel's strategic partnerships and technological advancements position the company well to capitalize on this demand.\n\nLooking ahead, Intel expects the momentum in wafer demand to continue, bolstered by the Synopsys partnership, ARM momentum, and the Tower agreement. These factors create a flywheel effect that could further enhance Intel's foundry services business. However, Intel will need to manage the underload hangover and improve manufacturing capabilities to fully realize the potential of this demand. Overall, the outlook for Intel's wafer services is positive, with opportunities for growth in revenue and profitability driven by strong market demand and strategic initiatives."

Maybe you can give a few day points or antidotes that might support that.\\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. And I do think there's clearly been the surge of interest in gen AI, which has, over a couple of quarters, driven a bias on the part of the cloud guys, in particular, to where do they put their floor space? Where do they put their power budgets, right? And that's been driving largely a race for the largest system environments that they can put in place. That said, training of these large models is interesting, but the deployment of those models, the inferencing use of those models is what we believe is truly spectacular for the future. And that will -- some of that will run on the accelerators, but a huge amount of that is going to run, right, on Xeons as we bring AI into those applications or AI-ification of existing applications. And given the leadership performance that we have on our Gen 4 for AI",

And our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Melius Research. Your question, please.\\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Pat, I was wondering if you could unpack your foundry comments. You have the customer that we've known about, where there's prepays. I think you mentioned there's two more customers that you're signing up and another by year-end, and then there's an event in the first quarter. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more detail and talk about how that's going to flow through and the materiality into the coming years as well.\\nPat Gelsinger: Yes. Thanks, Ben. Happy to unpack that a little bit more. So we announced back at the Deutsche Bank conference that we had our first major prepay customer for that. That effort has continued to go very well",

As my follow-up, one of the things that I keep getting asked about a ton is the CapEx swing that's happened towards gen AI infrastructure. And I guess the way that I've been kind of phrasing the question is the video killed the radio star question, right? Is this the death of CPU growth in the data center? And I don't think it is, to be clear, but there's some out there to do. So Pat, you made some comments in your script and then some other answers about return to normalcy on data center CPU from a growth perspective.

                    "init_answer": "The forecasted trends for Intel highlight a strategic focus on AI and data center CPU growth, driven by the demand for AI model deployment and inferencing, particularly leveraging Intel's Xeon processors. Historically, Intel has faced challenges in its data center business due to increased competition and a shift towards specialized accelerators for AI workloads. However, the narrative from the earnings call suggests optimism, with an emphasis on the significant role of CPUs in future AI applications.\n\nFinancially, Intel's Q3 2023 results show a gross profit of $6.018 billion on revenue of $14.158 billion, with a net income of $297 million. The gross profit ratio stands at 42.5%, and the operating income is slightly negative at -$8 million, indicating ongoing challenges in operational efficiency. Compared to Q3 2022, where Intel reported a revenue of $15.3 billion and a net income of $1.0 billion, there is a noticeable decline, reflecting the competitive pressures and market shifts Intel is addressing.\n\nIntel's strategic shift towards AI and data center CPUs is aimed at bolstering future growth. The company is capitalizing on the deployment of AI models, which are expected to utilize Xeon processors significantly. This approach aligns with market trends emphasizing the integration of AI into existing applications, potentially improving Intel's competitive positioning and financial outcomes in the long term.\n\nFor future performance, Intel anticipates the continued growth of AI applications will drive demand for its CPUs. The company's focus on AI-ification of applications and leveraging its Gen 4 AI capabilities is expected to contribute positively to its market position. While specific future guidance or projections were not detailed in the earnings call, the strategic initiatives indicate a commitment to enhancing Intel's role in the AI and data center sectors, aiming for improved financial metrics and market share in the coming years."

I have a follow-up. Intel showing pretty steady execution and I can't say that in the last several years, we haven't seen that. But just coming back to the long-term model that Dave you were talking about, can you just help us understand what are the parameters around that revenue, mix of the business? Because you will have an IFS which would be dilutive to gross margin, potentially not to operating margin. But what's the right way to think about that 60-40 in terms of the business mix and even size of the business?\\nDavid Zinsner: Yes. I'd say I think the first thing to kind of improve the gross",

I just wanted to come back to the DCAI. In the PowerPoint, you mentioned competitive pressure but I think, Dave, if I heard you correct, you said ASPs were a record. Could you just explain what you meant by competitive pressure because I would have thought that would have led to ASPs being lower, or was its impact was on the unit side?\\nPat Gelsinger: Yes, and there's a couple of things to unpack there. Just our views of the quarter, we would have expected that we lost some market share. That was based on competitive losses from last year even that are just rolling through our customers. That said, we did a bit better than we thought we would in the quarter. We are ramping",

As we said, the 270 million consumption TAM is something we indicated earlier in the year, and now we're seeing that play out exactly. And here we are three weeks into the quarter and I'd say it's looking really good. So our views and forecasts of our client business is very healthy for the fourth quarter. And we do think this idea of ushering in the AIPC generation will be a multiyear cycle. So we do think this will bring excitement into the category even starting with the Meteor Lake or the Core Ultra launch in Q4. We also have some other incremental tailwinds with Copilot launch from Microsoft coming up this quarter. We also have the Win 10 end-of-service support coming up. Those are just incremental tailwinds that just build us more confidence in it. And finally, our road map is great. And Meteor Lake looking good, rapidly ramping what we have"
